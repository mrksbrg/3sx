# 3SX

3SX is a native port of *Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike*. It's a continuation of [3s-decomp](https://github.com/crowded-street/3s-decomp) – a matching decompilation of 3rd Strike for PS2. 

> [!NOTE]
> 3SX is neither a recomp, nor emulation. It's native C code running directly on your hardware with no layers in between.

# Vision

For years fans have had to resort to less-than-ideal versions of 3S:
- Fightcade is great for playing online, but the fact that it's emulation-based makes it extremely hard (if not outright impossible) to add any meaningful features, aside from Lua training modes. It's also a pain to setup controllers for tournament play. And its second-class support for Linux and macOS makes it impossible to use in certain cases.
- 3S from the 30th Anniversary Collection is largely considered a subpar version, and its player base is very low what with the lack of crossplay.
- 3rd Strike Online Edition is beloved, yet flawed and abandoned. It's impossible to play on PC (outside of emulation) or modern consoles.

On the other hand, 3SX:
- brings first-class support for Windows, macOS and Linux (with possible ports to more platforms in the future)
- fixes arcade balance regressions introduced in PS2 version, providing a truly arcade-perfect experience (WIP)
- leverages GekkoNet to provide a fast, modern, cross-platform rollback netcode implementation

Our end goal with 3SX is to make **the ultimate version of 3rd Strike**: most responsive, most convenient, most easy-to-setup, most feature-rich, most played.

## Roadmap

Our goals for version 1.0:
- a stable PC experience
- easy access to online play
- auto-updates
- arcade ROM (legally obtained) as the only dependency

To track progress towards version 1.0 check our [1.0 milestone](https://github.com/crowded-street/3sx/milestone/1). To learn about other planned features check the [Backlog](https://github.com/crowded-street/3sx/milestone/2).

## How to play

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 3SX requires a legally obtained copy of *Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike* or *Street Fighter Anniversary Collection* for PlayStation 2 to run. This project does not condone piracy!

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/mrksbrg/3sx/releases) page for this fork.
   CI build artifacts for the latest pull requests are also available from the [Actions](https://github.com/mrksbrg/3sx/actions) tab.

2. Follow startup wizard prompts to provide 3SX with your legally obtained copy of the PS2 version.

   _or_

   Manually copy <iso path>/THIRD/SF33RD.AFS to [`resources`](docs/resources.md) folder.

3. (Optional) Edit [config](docs/config.md) to adjust various settings to your liking.

## Documentation

All documentation (including the build guide) can be found in [docs](docs) folder.

## Local build helpers

For quick local branch testing, the repo includes convenience scripts for building and packaging the current checkout:

- `./build-local.sh` chooses the right local helper for the current OS.
- `./build-local-mac.sh` is the currently implemented macOS flow.

Only macOS support has been implemented so far. The pattern is simple to extend for Linux or Windows by following the same structure: bootstrap dependencies, configure the project with CMake, build the current branch, and then run the platform-specific packaging step.

These scripts are intended for local validation of the current branch and are not a replacement for the repo's release automation.

## Developer validation setup

Before changing gameplay code, complete the platform setup in the
[build guide](docs/building.md), build the dependencies with
`sh build-deps.sh`, and install Python 3. The automated gameplay checks also
need a legally obtained `SF33RD.AFS` in the platform-specific
[resources directory](docs/resources.md); the repository never downloads or
distributes this file.

### Install the commit checks

The repository's pre-commit hook runs two gates:

1. CodeScene blocks a degraded staged file and requires new source files to
   score 10.0.
2. Changes staged under `src/sf33rd/Source/Game` trigger ten deterministic
   runs of 1,800 gameplay frames each and compare every saved rollback state
   with a build from `main`.

Install the CodeScene CLI and enable the repository hooks:

```bash
npm install -g @codescene/codehealth-mcp
cs-mcp --help
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Set `CS_MCP_BINARY_PATH` if `cs-mcp` is not installed globally.

### Create the replay baseline and candidate builds

Create the baseline before starting feature work. The explicit branch switches
are important: building both directories from the feature branch makes the
comparison meaningless.

```bash
git status
git switch main
sh build-deps.sh
CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake -B build-replay-main -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build-replay-main --parallel --config Debug

git switch -
CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake -B build-replay -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build-replay --parallel --config Debug
```

Run the gate directly at any time with:

```bash
THREESX_REPLAY_GUARD_FORCE=1 python3 tools/replay_precommit.py
```

The hook rebuilds `build-replay` before each relevant commit. Rebuild
`build-replay-main` from `main` whenever the base branch changes. A missing
baseline, candidate, dependency, or AFS file is a failure rather than a skipped
test. The gate stops at the first divergence and keeps both traces under
`build-replay-failures/seed-<seed>` for diagnosis.

Default executable locations are:

| Platform | Baseline | Candidate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | `build-replay-main/3SX.app/Contents/MacOS/3SX` | `build-replay/3SX.app/Contents/MacOS/3SX` |
| Linux | `build-replay-main/3sx` | `build-replay/3sx` |
| Windows | `build-replay-main/Debug/3sx.exe` | `build-replay/Debug/3sx.exe` |

Single-configuration Windows builds are also recognized. On Windows the hook
checks the standard MSYS2 MinGW64 location when `cmake` is not on `PATH`; set
`CMAKE` if it is installed elsewhere. Custom layouts can use
`THREESX_REPLAY_GUARD_BASELINE`, `THREESX_REPLAY_GUARD_CANDIDATE`, and
`THREESX_REPLAY_GUARD_BUILD_DIR`. Advanced users can override the comprehensive
defaults with `THREESX_REPLAY_GUARD_FIRST_SEED`, `THREESX_REPLAY_GUARD_SEEDS`,
`THREESX_REPLAY_GUARD_FRAMES`, `THREESX_REPLAY_GUARD_TIMEOUT`, and
`THREESX_REPLAY_GUARD_FAILURE_DIR`.

### Make, test, and commit a change

1. Make one focused change.
2. Build it with `cmake --build build-replay --parallel --config Debug`.
3. Play the affected behavior manually when practical.
4. Stage the intended files and run `git commit`; the installed hook runs both
   gates automatically.
5. For high-risk gameplay changes, run a longer comparison as documented in
   [Statcheck](docs/statcheck.md). For example on macOS:

   ```bash
   python3 tools/compare_stress_replays.py \
     build-replay-main/3SX.app/Contents/MacOS/3SX \
     build-replay/3SX.app/Contents/MacOS/3SX \
     --seeds 10 --frames 1800
   ```

The deterministic comparison proves parity with the selected `main` baseline.
It complements manual playtesting; it does not prove arcade accuracy in the way
CPS3-backed Statcheck does.
