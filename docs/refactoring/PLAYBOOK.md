# Refactoring Playbook

This is a **closed catalogue**. If a change you want to make is not one of the recipes
below, you are not allowed to make it as part of this campaign. Stop and report instead.

Every recipe here is *behaviour-preserving*: it moves code around without changing what
the program computes. That property is what makes this campaign safe to run at scale,
and it is the only reason a task can be handed to an agent that cannot run the game.

---

## The three rules

1. **One recipe, one function, one commit.** The unit is the *function*: a commit may
   apply the same recipe several times to it - four blocks extracted from one state
   machine is one commit - but it must not mix two different recipes, and it must not
   span two functions. The point is that a playtester can revert exactly one behaviour.
2. **Re-measure after every commit.** If the score improved, keep it. If it did not, run
   `code_health_review` and keep the change only when the function you targeted left a
   smell category or its cyclomatic complexity dropped. Otherwise revert. See
   *A flat score does not mean a failed refactor* below.
3. **When in doubt, stop and report.** An unfinished task is fine. A silently broken
   fighting-game engine is not.

---

## Absolutely forbidden

These will change behaviour and must never appear in a campaign commit:

- Changing any numeric literal, string literal, or enum value. **`case` labels are
  literals.** Renumbering states - rewriting `case 3:` as `case 0:` and subtracting an
  offset from the switch expression - is a literal change, however tempting it looks when
  two state machines differ only by their numbering.
- Changing arithmetic (`+ - * / %`), bit operations, or shifts.
- Changing a comparison operator, including `<` to `<=`.
- Reordering statements that have side effects (assignment, I/O, function calls).
- Changing types, including signedness (`s8` to `u8`) and width (`s16` to `s32`).
- "Fixing" a bug you spot. **Report it, leave it.** A faithful port reproduces original
  behaviour; what looks like a bug is often arcade-accurate.
- Deleting code that looks dead. It may be reachable through the replay/rollback path.
- Touching a `const` data table (the large static arrays). They are out of scope entirely.
- Renaming an existing function that is referenced from another file.

---

## Recipe E - Extract Function

**Use when:** CodeScene reports *Bumpy Road Ahead* (a function with several separate
blocks of nested logic). Each "bump" is a missing function.

**How:**

1. Find one nested block. It usually already has a comment or a blank line around it.
2. Cut it into a new `static` function directly above the current one.
3. Pass in every variable it reads as a parameter. Return the single value it produces.
4. If the block writes to more than one outer **local** variable, **skip it** and move to
   the next bump. Do not invent an out-parameter struct to carry results back.

   Writing many *fields* through a struct pointer the block already has - `ewk`, `wk`,
   `mwk` - is not what this rule is about. That is safe, and it is what most extractions
   in this codebase do. The rule exists to stop you inventing a way to return two values.

**Before:**

```c
void update_player(Player *p) {
    // ... other work ...
    if (p->state == STATE_HIT) {
        if (p->hit_timer > 0) {
            p->hit_timer--;
            if (p->hit_timer == 0) {
                p->state = STATE_IDLE;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**After:**

```c
static void tick_hit_recovery(Player *p) {
    if (p->state != STATE_HIT) {
        return;
    }
    if (p->hit_timer <= 0) {
        return;
    }
    p->hit_timer--;
    if (p->hit_timer == 0) {
        p->state = STATE_IDLE;
    }
}

void update_player(Player *p) {
    // ... other work ...
    tick_hit_recovery(p);
}
```

Name the new function for **what it does**, not where it came from. `tick_hit_recovery`,
not `update_player_part2`.

---

## Recipe G - Guard Clauses

**Use when:** CodeScene reports *Deep, Nested Complexity* (nesting depth 4 or more).

**How:** invert the outermost condition and return early. Repeat until the main body sits
at one level of indentation. This is the highest-value recipe in the campaign - it is
mechanical, and it directly attacks the smell that correlates most strongly with defects.

**Before:**

```c
if (player != NULL) {
    if (player->active) {
        if (player->health > 0) {
            do_the_real_work(player);
        }
    }
}
```

**After:**

```c
if (player == NULL) {
    return;
}
if (!player->active) {
    return;
}
if (player->health <= 0) {
    return;
}
do_the_real_work(player);
```

**Careful:** if the function returns a value, every guard must return the *same* value the
original code would have produced by falling through. Read the end of the function before
you start. If you cannot tell what it falls through to, skip the function and report it.

---

## Recipe P - Named Predicate

**Use when:** CodeScene reports *Complex Conditional* or *Complex Method* driven by
compound boolean expressions.

**How:** move the expression into a `static` function whose name states the intent. This
usually needs no other change, and it is the safest recipe in the catalogue.

**Before:**

```c
if ((p->flags & FLAG_AIR) && p->vy < 0 && !(p->flags & FLAG_STUN) && p->combo < 3) {
    ...
}
```

**After:**

```c
static bool can_air_combo(const Player *p) {
    return (p->flags & FLAG_AIR) && p->vy < 0 && !(p->flags & FLAG_STUN) && p->combo < 3;
}

if (can_air_combo(p)) {
    ...
}
```

Copy the expression **character for character**. Do not "simplify" the boolean algebra,
and do not reorder the operands - `&&` short-circuits, so reordering can change which
side effects run and can introduce null dereferences.

---

## Recipe D - Deduplicate

**Use when:** CodeScene reports *Code Duplication*.

**How:** only when the blocks are **identical or differ by a single value**. Extract one
`static` helper and pass the differing value as a parameter. If they differ in two or more
places, leave them alone - forcing a shared abstraction over near-miss duplicates is how
faithful ports get broken.

---

## Recipe V - Verbatim Values

**Use when:** a fixed skeleton is repeated many times and the instances differ in **two or
more literals**, so Recipe D refuses them, while Recipe C finds no identical run because
the literals sit in the middle of the skeleton rather than at one end.

**Added 2026-09-17** under the project owner's standing authorisation, and measured on
`next_cpu.c`'s `Setup_PL_Color` - cc 55, 141 lines, and fifteen copies of one `if`:

```c
    if (Player_Color[PL_id ^ 1] == 7 && id_0 == id_1) {
        Player_Color[PL_id] = 10;
    } else {
        Player_Color[PL_id] = 7;
    }
```

Fifteen of those, differing only in their pair of colours, became

```c
    Take_Player_Color(PL_id, 7, 10, id_0 == id_1);
```

**5.35 -> 5.79**, and the function's cyclomatic complexity fell by thirty.

**Why this is not Recipe D's forbidden case.** Recipe D refuses two differences because of
*mapping*: with two varying values there is somewhere for the pair to be crossed, and a
helper that picks between them can silently swap two arms. Recipe V removes that risk the
way Recipes T and F already do - **every varying literal is written out, in full, in
positional order, at its own call site**, so an arm's values cannot be mis-paired without
the single call line showing it, and the helper does nothing with them that the block did
not already do.

**Preconditions, all of them:**

- **The skeleton is identical character for character** in every instance apart from the
  literals. Not nearly identical - if a comparison operator, a subscript or a statement
  differs anywhere, those instances are not one family and Recipe D's refusal stands.
- **Only literals vary.** A varying *expression* is not this recipe. A varying callee is
  Recipe F's.
- **The helper performs exactly the operations that were there**, in the same order. It may
  test a parameter only where the block tested that same literal. It must not choose
  between two parameters, index with one, or compute from one.
- **Three or more instances.** Two is Recipe D's near-miss case and stays refused; this
  recipe is for a family large enough that the skeleton is plainly one idiom.
- **A condition hoisted into an argument must be pure.** Where the skeleton's test
  short-circuits, passing the right-hand side as an argument evaluates it every time.
  That is only legal when it reads locals or plain memory and calls nothing - in
  `Setup_PL_Color`, `id_0 == id_1` compares two `s8` locals. If the operand calls a
  function, reads volatile state, or could trap, leave the family alone.

**Amended 2026-09-20: a named constant is a varying literal, and a computed mask
travels whole.** Measured on `test_runner.c`, whose two input mappers are bit
tables written as code - ten copies of `if (w & (1 << 0)) buff |= SWK_UP;` and
sixteen of `state.south = (input & SWK_SOUTH) ? true : false;`.

Two readings, both deliberate, and both narrower than they look:

- **`SWK_UP` is a literal with a name.** Recipe V says "only literals vary", and
  the rule's purpose is that a varying *expression* could be evaluated
  differently at the call site than it was inline. A named constant cannot: it is
  written out verbatim at its own call site and the helper does nothing with it
  but the operation that was there. What stays excluded is what always was - an
  expression that reads state, calls something, or could trap.
- **Pass the mask, not the bit.** `add_flag_if_set(w, (1 << 0), SWK_UP, buff)`
  keeps `(1 << 0)` exactly as it stood, so the helper performs the single `&` the
  block performed and computes nothing from a parameter. Passing `0` and shifting
  inside measures identically and needs Recipe N's narrow licence instead;
  prefer the form that does not.

**A varying struct field travels as its address**, for the same reason: C has no
way to pass a member name, `&state.south` is written out in full at its own call
site, and the helper does the one assignment that stood there. Two different
field *types* are two skeletons and need two helpers - `bool*` and `Sint16*`
cannot share one without a type change.

`apply_input_buffer` went cc 17 to 1 and `read_input_buff` cc 12 to 2; the file
went **7.92 -> 10.00** across the session.

**Where the skeleton ends inside control flow**, the helper returns `0` or `1` and each
caller branches on it, exactly as Recipe C prescribes. Return nothing else - a verdict
wider than a yes/no is the helper deciding something, which this recipe does not allow.

**Amended 2026-09-19: three may be two, when a machine does the fold and checks it.**
The three-instance rule was a proxy for a question a human reader cannot answer cheaply -
*is this skeleton one idiom, or two blocks that happen to look alike?* Where the fold is
generated by `tools/passive_fold.py` and checked by its `verify` command, that question is
answered mechanically instead: `verify` rebuilds the step-to-statement map of every pattern
function on both sides of the change and diffs them, so a fold that merged two blocks which
were not the same idiom shows up as a differing step, not as a judgement call. Under those
two conditions - **generated, and verified by re-expansion** - two instances are enough.

The rule stands unchanged for a fold done by hand or by eye. It is the verification, not
the instance count, that makes the merge safe, and a hand-written merge of two near-misses
is still Recipe D's forbidden case.

Measured on `Game/com/active`, which had stopped at a mean of 8.64 with 74 scripts sitting
in families of exactly two: `gfold --min-members 2` folded **72 of them onto 36 skeletons**,
`verify` reported 1621 pattern functions and 0 differing, and the folder's mean went to
**8.91** with the files at 10.00 rising from four to nine.

**Amended 2026-09-20: two is enough when `inline_equiv.py` checks the fold.**
The 2026-09-19 amendment relaxed the three-instance rule where the fold was
*generated* and *verified by re-expansion*, and said in its own words that "it is the
verification, not the instance count, that makes the merge safe". The generator was
`passive_fold.py`, because that is what the pattern folders had. `tools/inline_equiv.py`
answers the same question for a fold written by hand: it substitutes the helper's body
back into each call site and diffs the result against the original function, so a
transposed argument, a renamed parameter or a dropped statement shows up as a differing
function rather than as a judgement call.

So a **two-instance** family may be folded when **all** of these hold, on top of every
precondition above:

- **The skeleton is byte-identical apart from the literals.** Not nearly - run a diff, do
  not read it by eye. If a statement, an operator or a subscript differs anywhere, this is
  Recipe D's refused near-miss and stays refused.
- **Only literals vary**, under this recipe's existing reading of "literal": a number, a
  named constant, or a struct field travelling as its address.
- **`tools/inline_equiv.py --helper <name> <file>` reports 0 differ.** A DIFFERS is read
  rather than obeyed - the four blind spots below apply - but it has to be resolved before
  the fold lands, not after.
- **The guard shows the deduplication WARN** with every value still present.

What this does not relax: two blocks that differ in anything but their literals are still
Recipe D's forbidden case, and no amount of checking makes them one idiom.

Measured on `Game/ending`, which is where the question was raised: `end_18.c`'s pair
differs in an effect id and a message index and nothing else, and folding it measures
**9.38 -> 10.00**.

**The original open question, left for the record.** Six files in `Game/ending`
plateau at 9.38 with nothing left but a *two-instance* family of this exact shape - one
skeleton, identical character for character, differing only in literals that would be
written out at both call sites. `end_18.c`'s pair differs in an effect id and a message
index; `end_10.c` has two such pairs. Recipe V refuses them only because of the
three-instance rule.

That rule is not arbitrary and was not relaxed here on the agent's own judgement: with two
instances there is no third case to confirm the skeleton really is one idiom rather than
two blocks that happen to look alike this week, and merging two near-misses is precisely
what Recipe D forbids. But the six files are a measurable cost, and the owner may judge
the evidence sufficient at two where the skeleton is byte-identical apart from the
literals. Left as it stands pending that call.

**What the guard shows.** The deduplication WARN, with **one copy of each literal removed
per instance** and every value still present at its call site. A *value* leaving the
fingerprint means it did not travel to the call site and the merge is wrong.

---

## Recipe C - Extract Common Part

**Use when:** CodeScene reports *Code Duplication* and the blocks share a **contiguous
identical run** - a prefix, a suffix, or a middle - but differ elsewhere, so Recipe D does
not apply.

This is the mirror image of Recipe D, and it is safer. Recipe D moves the *difference*
into the helper as a parameter. Recipe C moves only the *identical* part, and every
difference stays at the call site where it is still visible and still unchanged.

**How:**

1. Find the longest run of lines that is identical in both blocks, character for
   character. Whitespace may differ; nothing else may.
2. Move exactly that run into a `static` helper. Do not tidy it on the way.
3. Leave everything else at the call sites, in its original order.
4. If the shared run ends inside control flow - the callers need to know whether to carry
   on - the helper returns `0` or `1` and each caller branches on it. Return nothing else.

**Before:**

```c
static void advance_4000(Work *w) {
    if (!paused()) {
        move(w);
        if (--w->timer <= 0) {
            w->state++;
            set_anim(w, 29);          /* <- differs */
        }
    }
}

static void advance_11000(Work *w, Work *parent) {
    if (!paused()) {
        move(w);
        if (--w->timer <= 0) {
            w->state++;
            parent->cmd = 9;          /* <- differs */
        }
    }
}
```

**After:**

```c
static s32 approach_complete(Work *w) {
    if (!paused()) {
        move(w);
        if (--w->timer <= 0) {
            w->state++;
            return 1;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

static void advance_4000(Work *w) {
    if (approach_complete(w)) {
        set_anim(w, 29);
    }
}

static void advance_11000(Work *w, Work *parent) {
    if (approach_complete(w)) {
        parent->cmd = 9;
    }
}
```

**Careful:** this does **not** license merging near-miss blocks by parameterising two or
more differences. That is exactly what Recipe D forbids, and it stays forbidden. If you
cannot point at a contiguous run that is identical, there is nothing here to extract.

`refactor_guard.py` reports this shape as a WARN - *copies removed, 0/1 returns added* -
because the call sites lose the run's literals while the helper brings its own returns.

---

## Recipe T - Shared Table Scan

**Use when:** a function is built out of the same **threshold-table scan** repeated several
times, and the instances differ only in the table, its row count, and the value scanned -
so Recipe D's single-difference rule refuses them and Recipe C finds no identical run
because the table name sits inside the loop.

This is the idiom `grade.c` is made of:

```c
for (i = 0; i < 23; i++) {
    if (num < grade_t_meichuuritsu2[i + 1][0]) {
        break;
    }
}

point2 = grade_t_meichuuritsu2[i][1];
```

Three things vary, which is why this needed its own entry rather than a relaxation of
Recipe D. It is safe for a different reason than Recipe D is: **all three varying things
are values copied verbatim from the call site**, and the only code that moves is the loop
itself, which moves once and unchanged. Nothing is generalised; the scan is not rewritten
to cope with a new case.

**How:**

1. Name the table's **row type in a header**, next to the tables' own declarations:

   ```c
   /* grade.h */
   typedef const s16 GradeRow[2];
   ```

   This is not cosmetic. Written directly, the parameter is `const s16 table[][2]`, and
   that `2` is a literal new to the `.c` file; against the literals the merge removes,
   `refactor_guard.py` reads the pair as *a constant was substituted* and FAILs. With the
   row type named, the `.c` gains no literal and the fingerprint reads the deduplication
   it actually is.

2. Extract **one** `static` helper holding the scan, character for character as it stands:

   ```c
   static s16 table_points(const GradeRow* table, s16 count, s16 value) {
       s16 i;

       for (i = 0; i < count; i++) {
           if (value < table[i + 1][0]) {
               break;
           }
       }

       return table[i][1];
   }
   ```

3. Each call site passes **its own** table by name, **its own** bound, and **its own**
   scanned expression, each written exactly as it appears today. The bound stays a literal
   at the call site - it is not derived with `sizeof`, and it is not moved into the table.

4. The helper returns the row's score and does nothing else. It does not accumulate into
   `point`, clamp, or take a second table.

**Preconditions, all of them:**

- The loop body is identical across every instance apart from the table name, the bound,
  and the scanned value. If the comparison operator, the `+ 1`, or the column indices
  differ anywhere, those instances are not one family - leave them.
- Every table has the same row type. A family scanning `const s16 t[N][2]` and one
  scanning `const s16 t[N][3]` are two families, and merging them would be a type change.
- The tables themselves are never touched, reordered, or re-declared. Recipe T reads them
  through a pointer; the `const` arrays stay exactly as they are.
- **The bounds and the scanned values are still there afterwards.** The expected literal
  fingerprint is the deduplication WARN - *copies removed, every value still present* -
  and the counts say exactly what was collapsed: eight scans sharing one loop read as
  `removed x14 num 0` and `removed x14 num 1`, sixteen of each in the loops against two of
  each kept in the helper. If a *bound* leaves the fingerprint, it did not travel to the
  call site and the merge is wrong. The header's own diff is the legal "literals added,
  none removed".

**Group the scans by what they score.** Nine scans behind one helper is fine; three
helpers of three scans each read as duplicates of one another and the score falls.

**The same argument covers a table *selection*, not just a scan.** Where several arms
choose between the same two tables the same way and differ only in which pair they name,
one helper can take the pair:

```c
static const u16* select_waza_table(const PLW* wk, s16 kos, AsstblCharRows* arcade, AsstblCharRows* ps2) {
    if (ArcadeBalance_IsEnabled()) {
        return arcade[CHAR_3SX_TO_ARCADE(wk->player_number)][kos];
    }

    return ps2[wk->player_number][kos];
}
```

and each arm passes its own two by name:

```c
    wst = select_waza_table(wk, kos, asstbl_lv_2000_arcade, _asstbl_lv_2000);
```

This is two differing values, which Recipe D refuses, and it is safe for Recipe T's reason
rather than Recipe D's: **both tables are written out verbatim at the call site, and the
helper does nothing with them but the two subscripts it already performed.** The moment it
tests one, picks between them on anything but the flag that was already there, or computes
an index from a parameter, that argument is gone and this is Recipe D's forbidden case.

The preconditions are Recipe T's, plus one:

- The selection rule is identical in every arm - the same flag, the same subscripts on
  each side. If one arm indexes the arcade table differently, the arms are not one family.
- Tables of different first extent are fine and are the usual case: `[20][6][2]` and
  `[21][6][2]` both decay to the same parameter type. **The extents that remain must be
  named in a header**, for the reason the array-typed-parameter rule below gives - written
  out, the `[6][2]` is two literals new to the `.c` and the guard reads the pair as a
  substitution.

Measured on `pls03.c`'s `waza_select`, whose five arms each chose between an arcade table
and the PS2 one: **8.08 -> 8.19**, cc 20 -> 15, and five copies of the `ArcadeBalance`
branch collapsed into one.

---

## Recipe B - Shared Buffer Loop

**Use when:** two or more loops walk a **caller-named buffer** up to a
**caller-named length** and are otherwise identical character for character - so Recipe D
refuses them for having two differences, and Recipe C finds no identical run because the
buffer name sits in the `for`-init and the length in its condition.

This is Recipe T with the `const` table replaced by an ordinary array. Recipe T's
preconditions are written around a threshold scan over a static table, which is why a
plain buffer needed its own entry rather than a relaxation.

**Added 2026-09-18** under the project owner's standing authorisation, and measured on
`texcash.c`'s `search_texcash_free_area`, whose 16- and 32-page halves count their free
entries the same way:

```c
    for (mc = mts[ix].mltcsh16, i = 0; i < mts[ix].mltnum16; i++) {
        if (mc[i].cs.code == -1) {
            num++;
        }
    }
```

Two of those became

```c
    num = count_free_cash_entries(mts[ix].mltcsh16, mts[ix].mltnum16);
```

**8.81 -> 9.16**, cc 9 -> 5, and the function left both Complex Method and Bumpy Road.

**Why this is not Recipe D's forbidden case.** The same argument that makes Recipe T safe:
**both varying things are written out in full, in positional order, at their own call
site**, so no pair can be crossed without the one call line showing it, and the loop moves
once with nothing about it rewritten. The helper does with its parameters exactly what the
loop did - it indexes the buffer and it bounds the count - and nothing else.

**Preconditions, all of them:**

- **The loop body is identical** across every instance apart from the buffer and the
  length. If a subscript, a comparison operator or a statement differs anywhere, those
  instances are not one family and Recipe D's refusal stands.
- **Only the buffer and its length vary.** A third varying name - an index table, a
  counter written through - is not this recipe. Extra parameters are how a shared loop
  turns into a generalised one.
- **The loop cannot move its own bound.** This is the precondition a plain array needs and
  a `const` table does not. The original re-reads the length on every pass; the helper
  takes it by value once. Those agree only if nothing the body writes can reach the length,
  so the body must write **only its own locals**, or write through a pointer that provably
  cannot alias the length's storage. If you cannot settle the aliasing by construction,
  leave the family alone - extract one of the loops with Recipe E instead and accept the
  asymmetry.
- **The parameter types are the field types**, not the loop variable's. In
  `search_texcash_free_area` the counter `i` is `s16` and `mltnum16` is `s32`, so the
  parameter is `s32` and the comparison promotes exactly as it did before. Narrowing it to
  match `i` would be a type change and is forbidden.
- **The buffer parameter is `const` where the loop only reads it.** That is not a type
  change in the forbidden sense - it constrains the new helper, not any existing
  declaration - and it is what makes the aliasing precondition checkable.
- **Two instances are enough**, unlike Recipe V. Recipe V's three-instance rule exists
  because a family of two skeletons might be two blocks that merely resemble each other;
  here the skeleton is a single loop with its buffer and bound hoisted, and there is nothing
  in it for a third case to confirm.

**What the guard shows.** The deduplication WARN - one copy of the loop's own literals
removed, every value still present, at a call site or in the helper. A *length* leaving the
fingerprint means it did not travel to the call site and the merge is wrong.

---

## Recipe N - Shared Index Range

**Use when:** two or more scans are identical character for character except for the
**first index and the limit of the range they walk** - so Recipe D refuses them for having
two differences, Recipe C finds no identical run because the two literals sit in the
`for`-init and its condition, and Recipe B does not reach them because the buffer is the
same in every instance and it is the *range* that moves.

This is Recipe B with the pair of varying things changed from *(buffer, length)* to
*(first, limit)*. It needed its own entry rather than a relaxation of B because B's
preconditions are written around a caller-named buffer, and here there is none.

**Added 2026-09-18** under the project owner's standing authorisation, and measured on
`bg.c`'s two ending chip remaps, which scan the same `rw_dat` for the same key and take
the same replacement, over two halves of it:

```c
static s32 remap_ending_c_kakikae1_chip(s32 global_index_real) {
    for (i = 0; i < 8; i++) {          /* the twin runs i = 8; i < 16 */
        if (global_index_real == rw_dat[i].rwgbix) {
            global_index_real = rw_dat[i].rwd_ptr[c_number];
            ...
```

The two became one helper taking the range, with each arm of the `c_kakikae` dispatch
naming its own half:

```c
    case 1:  global_index_real = remap_ending_c_chip_in_range(global_index_real, 0, 8);   break;
    case 2:  global_index_real = remap_ending_c_chip_in_range(global_index_real, 8, 16);
```

**Why this is not Recipe D's forbidden case.** The same argument that makes Recipes T, B,
V, W and F safe: **both varying values are written out in full, in positional order, at
their own call site**, so no pair can be crossed without the one call line showing it, and
the loop moves once with nothing about it rewritten. The helper uses `first` only as the
loop's initial value and `limit` only in the condition it already stood in. It does not
index with either, test either, or compute from either.

**Preconditions, all of them:**

- **The loop body is identical** across every instance, character for character. If a
  subscript, a comparison operator, a callee or a statement differs anywhere, those
  instances are not one family and Recipe D's refusal stands.
- **Only the first index and the limit vary.** A third varying name or expression is not
  this recipe.
- **The comparison is copied, not chosen.** `i < limit` because the original wrote
  `i < 8`. Turning a `<` into a `<=` to make two instances fit is the forbidden operator
  change, and two instances that disagree on it are two families.
- **The loop cannot move its own bound**, exactly as Recipe B requires. The original
  re-reads the limit on every pass and the helper takes it by value once, so the body must
  write only its own locals, or write through a pointer that provably cannot alias the
  limit's storage. In `bg.c` the body assigns one local and calls two `ppg` functions that
  touch only the texture lists.
- **The parameter types are the loop variable's**, so the comparison promotes exactly as it
  did. `remap_ending_c_chip_in_range` takes `s32` because `i` is `s32`.
- **Two instances are enough**, for Recipe B's reason rather than Recipe V's: the skeleton
  is a single loop with its range hoisted, and there is nothing in it for a third case to
  confirm.

**What the guard shows.** The deduplication WARN, with one copy of the body's own literals
removed and **every bound still present at its call site**. A bound leaving the fingerprint
means it did not travel to the call site and the merge is wrong. `--calls` shows the body's
callees dropping by the copies removed; if the merged functions had names of their own,
declare the collapse with `--renamed OLD=NEW` for each of them.

**One value may ride along with the range**, on the argument Recipe F already uses for a
value travelling beside its pointers: written out in full at its own call site, with the
helper using it only where the original used that same expression. Measured on `bg.c`'s two
ending `g_kakikae` remaps, which differ in their range *and* in the column they read -
`rw_dat[i].rwd_ptr[g_number[0]]` against `[g_number[1]]`:

```c
    if (g_kakikae[0]) {
        global_index_real = remap_ending_g_chip_in_range(global_index_real, 0, 12, g_number[0]);
    }

    if (g_kakikae[1]) {
        global_index_real = remap_ending_g_chip_in_range(global_index_real, 12, 20, g_number[1]);
    }
```

**8.28 -> 8.81**, and the pair became one function.

This is the one place any recipe in this catalogue lets a helper *index* with a parameter,
so the licence is narrow and the reason is worth stating. Recipe V forbids indexing because
a helper that indexes with something it chose has generalised the difference: the mapping
from arm to value now lives inside it, where a crossed pair is invisible. Here nothing is
chosen. `g_number[0]` is written out at the call site that had it, in positional order, and
the helper performs the one subscript the original performed, on the value it was handed.

**What does not relax:**

- **Exactly one value, and it is an argument, not a selector.** The helper must not test it,
  compare two of them, or derive a second value from it. The moment it picks between things
  with it, this is Recipe D's forbidden near-miss again.
- **The value's expression must be free of side effects**, for the reason Recipe V gives:
  the original evaluated it inside the loop, zero times when nothing matched, and the call
  site now evaluates it once always. That is unobservable only when it reads locals or plain
  memory and calls nothing. `g_number[0]` is a read of a `u8` array.
- **Its parameter type is the type the expression already had**, so the promotion at the
  subscript is the one that happened before. `column` is `u8` because `g_number` is.

---

## Recipe F - Action Parameter

**Use when:** two or more functions - or two or more arms of one `switch` - share a control
skeleton that is identical character for character **except for the name of one function
being called**. Recipe D allows a differing *value*; this is the same shape with a differing
*callee*, which no existing recipe reaches.

**Before:**

```c
static s32 comm_pa_x(PLW* wk, CTC* ctc) {
    switch (ctc->koc) {
    case 0:  add_script_x_offset(wk, ctc);  break;
    case 2:  add_script_x_offset(wk, ctc);  /* fallthrough */
    default: emwk = (WORK*)wk->target_adrs; add_script_x_offset(emwk, ctc); break;
    }
    return 1;
}

static s32 comm_pa_y(PLW* wk, CTC* ctc) {
    switch (ctc->koc) {
    case 0:  add_script_y_offset(wk, ctc);  break;
    case 2:  add_script_y_offset(wk, ctc);  /* fallthrough */
    default: emwk = (WORK*)wk->target_adrs; add_script_y_offset(emwk, ctc); break;
    }
    return 1;
}
```

**After:**

```c
static s32 dispatch_by_koc(PLW* wk, CTC* ctc, void (*action)(PLW*, CTC*)) {
    switch (ctc->koc) {
    case 0:  action(wk, ctc);  break;
    case 2:  action(wk, ctc);  /* fallthrough */
    default: emwk = (WORK*)wk->target_adrs; action(emwk, ctc); break;
    }
    return 1;
}

static s32 comm_pa_x(PLW* wk, CTC* ctc) { return dispatch_by_koc(wk, ctc, add_script_x_offset); }
static s32 comm_pa_y(PLW* wk, CTC* ctc) { return dispatch_by_koc(wk, ctc, add_script_y_offset); }
```

**Preconditions, all of them:**

- **Exactly one call differs, and nothing else.** If the arms differ in a second callee or
  in a statement, Recipe F does not apply - that is the near-miss case Recipe D forbids,
  and it stays forbidden.
- **The call may differ whole** - the callee *and* the arguments it is given. The nine
  attack stances in `pls03.c` differ in which selector they call and at which level, and
  both travel into the helper's argument list at each arm:

  ```c
  case 20:
      return start_nm_attack(wk, kos, 3, select_nm_attack_level_3010);
  ```

  This is not "parameterise two differences". It is safe for the reason Recipe T is safe:
  every varying part is written out verbatim at its own call site, so no arm's pair can be
  mis-mapped, and the helper **does nothing with those parameters except pass them
  straight to the call**. It must not test them, index with them, or compute from them -
  the moment it does, the differences have been generalised and this is Recipe D's
  forbidden case again.
- **The callees' signatures are identical**, parameter for parameter, return type included.
  The parameter is written with that exact prototype. Casting a function pointer to make
  two signatures fit is a type change and is forbidden outright - it is also undefined
  behaviour.
- **The arguments at the call are unchanged**, in the same order, with the same
  expressions. `action(emwk, ctc)` is legal because `add_script_x_offset(emwk, ctc)` was
  what stood there.
- **Nothing becomes non-`static` to be pointed at.** Taking the address of a file-local
  function is fine; widening linkage so a helper in another file can be named here is not,
  and is not what this recipe is for.
- The pointer is passed **as a bare name at the call site**, never stored in a table or a
  struct field, never chosen at run time. Recipe F replaces a duplicated skeleton; it does
  not introduce dispatch the program did not have.

  **One narrowing of that, added 2026-09-18** and measured on `mtrans.c`'s three extended
  transfer entry points. Where the fixed arguments plus the pointers would take the shared
  body over four parameters, the varying parts may travel in a **compound literal built at
  the call site**:

  ```c
  void mlt_obj_trans_ext(MultiTexture* mt, WORK* wk, s32 base_y) {
      mlt_obj_trans_ext_common(
          mt, wk, base_y, &(ExtTransVariant){ 0, store_cached_trans_ext_tiles, store_new_trans_ext_tiles });
  }
  ```

  Three fixed arguments plus two pointers plus a seed value is six, which would have traded
  a three-function duplication group for an Excess Number of Function Arguments finding.
  The literal is not the hazard the rule guards against: it is built where it is used,
  holds bare names only, is never assigned to a variable and never put in a table, and each
  entry point still targets exactly one pair, fixed at compile time. **No dispatch exists
  that did not exist before**, which is the whole of the rule's purpose.

  What stays forbidden is the thing the rule was written for: a `static` table of variants
  indexed at run time, or a variant pointer held in a struct that outlives the call.

  **A value may ride along in that literal**, on Recipe V's argument rather than this one -
  written out in full at its own call site, with the helper doing nothing with it but
  assign it where the original assigned it. In `mtrans.c` that value is the pattern code's
  group seed, `0` at two call sites and `wk->colcd` at the third.

**More than one callee may differ, on the same argument.** Added 2026-09-17 under the
project owner's standing authorisation, and measured on `entry.c`'s five screen
dispatchers, which were identical apart from *two* callees each:

```c
void Entry_03() {
    switch (E_No[1]) {
    case 0:      Entry_03_1st();  break;
    default:     Entry_03_2nd();  break;
    }
}
```

Five of those, differing only in the pair they name, became
`Entry_Screen_Step(Entry_03_1st, Entry_03_2nd)` and four siblings like it: **4.36 ->
4.74**, and five of the file's eight duplication groups went at once.

The safety argument is unchanged by the count, and that is the point. What makes Recipe F
safe is not that one thing varies but that **every varying name is written out verbatim at
its own call site, and the helper does nothing with any of them except call it.** A second
pointer cannot be mis-mapped against the first: both are positional parameters named in
full at every call site, so there is no place for a pair to be crossed that reading the one
line would not show. Adding a third would be the same.

What does *not* relax:

- **Only callees may differ.** If the arms also differ in a statement, an operator or a
  value, Recipe F still does not apply - that remains Recipe D's forbidden near-miss.
- **The helper still only calls them.** The moment it tests a pointer, compares two of
  them, or picks between them, the differences have been generalised and this is forbidden
  again.
- Every other precondition above stands: identical signatures, unchanged arguments, nothing
  widened from `static`, and the pointer passed as a bare name rather than stored.

**The guard needs telling.** `--calls` counts a name as a call only when a `(` follows it,
so a callee now passed by pointer reads as a vanished call and FAILs. Declare each one:

```bash
python tools/refactor_guard.py --calls --fnptr add_script_x_offset \
                               --fnptr add_script_y_offset src/.../charset_position.c
```

The declaration is yours, not a guess by the tool: the counts still have to balance
afterwards, and the expected signature is Recipe C/D's - each shared callee drops by the
copies removed, and the new helper is `+1` per call site plus `+1` for its definition.

**This is control flow.** Every application of Recipe F reroutes a call through a pointer,
so it belongs in the *genuinely high risk* tier of the verification loop: run
`tools/replay_verify.sh` on it, not just the build and the guards.

---

## Recipe W - Shared Call Site

**Use when:** several places make the **same call with the same long argument list**,
differing only in a small number of argument *expressions*. Recipe D refuses two or more
differences; Recipe C finds no identical run, because what varies sits in the middle of the
argument list rather than at one end; and Recipe V does not apply, because what varies are
expressions rather than literals.

**Added 2026-09-18** under the project owner's standing authorisation, and measured on
`mtrans.c`, where all nine `store_*` tile passes end each switch arm with the same
nine-argument call:

```c
            rnum = seqsStoreChip(
                x - (dw * BOOL(run->flip & 0x8000)),
                y + (dh * BOOL(run->flip & 0x4000)),
                dw,
                dh,
                run->mt->mltgidx16,                                  /* <- differs */
                code,
                run->palo | ((trsptr->attr ^ run->flip) & 0xC000),   /* <- differs */
                run->wk->my_clear_level,
                run->mt->id
            );
```

Eighteen of those, identical in seven arguments and differing in two, became

```c
            rnum = store_trans_chip(&(ChipPlacement){ x, y, dw, dh, run->flip, run->wk->my_clear_level, run->mt->id },
                                    run->mt->mltgidx16,
                                    code,
                                    run->palo | ((trsptr->attr ^ run->flip) & 0xC000));
```

**6.15 -> 6.64**, 126 lines out of the file, and two functions left Large Method.

**Why this is safe.** The same argument as Recipes T, V and F: **every varying part is
written out in full, in positional order, at its own call site**, so no pair can be crossed
without the one call line showing it, and the helper **does nothing with any parameter but
pass it to the argument position it already occupied**. It does not test one, index with
one, or compute from one.

**Preconditions, all of them:**

- **The same callee, the same number of arguments, in every instance.** A differing callee
  is Recipe F's.
- **Every argument that is not a parameter of the helper is identical character for
  character** across all instances. Not nearly identical - a differing parenthesisation or
  a differing operand order means those instances are not one family.
- **Every argument is free of side effects.** This is the precondition a call has that a
  statement does not. The arguments of a call are evaluated in an unspecified order, and
  the helper changes that order: the shared ones are now computed inside it, after the
  varying ones have been computed at the call site. That is unobservable only when no
  argument writes anything, calls anything, or reads volatile state. If one does, leave the
  family alone.
- **The helper still comes in at four parameters or fewer.** Where the shared arguments
  outnumber the varying ones, give the shared ones a parameter object built at the call
  site, as Recipe A prescribes - `mtrans.c`'s seven shared values plus three varying ones
  would otherwise have made a ten-argument helper and traded one finding for another.
- **Check the argument lists mechanically, not by eye.** Eighteen instances of a
  nine-argument call is more than a reading confirms. Extract every instance's arguments,
  group them by position, and look at how many distinct spellings each position has; a
  position with one spelling is shared and a position with several is a parameter. An
  instance that does not fit is not in the family.

**What the guard shows.** The deduplication WARN, with the shared arguments' literals
removed once per instance collapsed and every value still present, and `--calls` showing
the callee and anything inside the shared arguments dropping by the copies removed against
the helper's `+1` per call site and `+1` for its definition. On `mtrans.c` that read as
`removed x17 num 32768`, `-17 seqsStoreChip`, `-34 BOOL` and `+19 store_trans_chip` -
eighteen copies becoming one.

---

## Recipe X - Split Dispatch

**Use when:** CodeScene reports *Complex Method* on a function whose complexity is mostly
its own `switch` - a state machine with more arms than the threshold allows. Recipe E does
not help: there is no bump of nested logic to lift out, only arms.

**How:**

1. Choose a contiguous group of later arms that belong together - the airborne half of a
   jump, the teardown of an effect.
2. Move them to a `static` helper that switches on **the same expression**.
3. Reach the helper from the original `default:` arm.

**The binding constraint: case labels are never renumbered.** The helper keeps the
original labels, so a state still reads as the number the rest of the engine uses. If you
find yourself writing `switch (index - 2)` with labels `0..4`, stop - that is a literal
change, and it is forbidden.

**Before:**

```c
void term(Work *w, s16 a) {
    switch (w->index) {
    case 0: begin(w); break;
    case 1: launch(w); break;
    case 2: rise(w); break;
    case 3: climb(w, a); break;
    case 4: strike(w, a); break;
    default: land(w); break;
    }
}
```

**After:**

```c
/* The airborne half: everything from the rise onwards. The case labels are the
 * original ones, so the states still read as the same numbers. */
static void term_airborne(Work *w, s16 a) {
    switch (w->index) {
    case 2: rise(w); break;
    case 3: climb(w, a); break;
    case 4: strike(w, a); break;
    default: land(w); break;
    }
}

void term(Work *w, s16 a) {
    switch (w->index) {
    case 0: begin(w); break;
    case 1: launch(w); break;
    default: term_airborne(w, a); break;
    }
}
```

Anything that ran after the switch - a trailing lever merge, a sort request - stays in the
caller, after its switch, where it ran before.

**The group may also be chosen by what two switches agree on.** When two sibling state
machines are a Code Duplication pair because several of their arms are identical, the same
move breaks the pair: put the arms they share in one helper, and let *both* switches reach
it from a new `default`. Measured on `plpat06.c`'s run and throw markers, which agree on
arms 20, 30 and 40 and disagree on the rest: 8.81 -> 9.38, and the finding went.

The safety argument is the one above plus one more step. Case labels are mutually
exclusive, so a `cg_type` of 20 that used to match the caller's own arm now falls to the
`default` and matches the same label in the helper. A value matching none of the labels did
nothing before, and still does nothing - **provided neither caller had a `default` of its
own and the helper does not add one.** If either switch already has a `default`, this
variant does not apply: the values that used to reach it would now reach the helper first.

---

## Recipe L - Lookup Table

**Use when:** CodeScene reports *Complex Method* on a function that is a `switch` whose
every arm is a single `return <constant>;`. Recipe X can split such a switch in two, but it
only halves a number that need not exist at all: a switch like this is a lookup table
written as control flow, and the complexity is entirely the arms.

**The conditions, all four:**

1. Every arm is exactly one `return` of a compile-time constant - a literal, a string
   literal, or an enumerator. No side effects, no calls, no fallthrough between arms.
2. The controlling expression is a plain enum or integer value, not an expression with its
   own effects.
3. The switch has a `default:`, and it too returns a constant.
4. The enum has a count macro or a last enumerator that bounds it. Without one there is no
   bound to check and the recipe does not apply.

**How:**

1. Write a `static const` array of the arm type, sized by the count macro, using
   **designated initialisers keyed by the case labels**. One entry per arm, in the order the
   arms were written.
2. Replace the function body with a range guard returning the old `default:` constant, a
   second guard for a hole in the table returning the same, and the table lookup.

**Before:**

```c
static const char *name_of(Button b) {
    switch (b) {
    case BUTTON_UP:    return "up";
    case BUTTON_DOWN:  return "down";
    /* ... fourteen more ... */
    default:           return "";
    }
}
```

**After:**

```c
/* The names, one per enumerator, keyed by the enumerator itself. */
static const char *const button_names[BUTTON_COUNT] = {
    [BUTTON_UP] = "up",
    [BUTTON_DOWN] = "down",
    /* ... fourteen more ... */
};

/* The empty string stands for every button the table does not name, which is what
 * the switch's default arm did: out of range, and the hole an enumerator added
 * without a name would leave. */
static const char *name_of(Button b) {
    if (b < 0 || b >= BUTTON_COUNT) {
        return "";
    }

    if (button_names[b] == NULL) {
        return "";
    }

    return button_names[b];
}
```

**Why the designators matter.** Keying each entry by its case label is what makes the
transformation checkable: the table is the same set of label-to-constant pairs the switch
held, readable side by side against the original, and nothing depends on the enum being
dense, zero-based, or listed in order. A positional array would depend on all three, and
would go wrong silently the first time an enumerator was inserted.

**Why the second guard.** A `switch` sends *every* unlisted value to `default:`, including
enumerators someone adds later. The table sends them to a zero entry instead. The
`== NULL` test - or `== 0` for an integer table whose real values are all non-zero - is
what keeps that case returning what `default:` returned. Where a table's legitimate values
include the zero it would use as its hole, the recipe does not apply; use Recipe X.

**Keep the two guards separate.** Folding them into one `||` chain of three tests trades
*Complex Method* for *Complex Conditional*, measured on `keymap.c`: the one-condition form
scored 9.68 and the two-guard form 10.00.

**What it is worth.** `keymap.c`'s `get_button_name` went cc 18 -> 4 and the file 8.92 ->
10.00, clearing *Complex Method* and *Overall Code Complexity* together - the second
because a file's mean complexity falls a long way when its largest function stops being a
switch.

**The forbidden list bars touching a `const` data table.** Recipe L *creates* one, out of
the arms of a switch that is already in front of you. It gives no licence to read from,
reorder, index into, or edit a table that was already there.

`refactor_guard.py` sees no constant change: the arms' constants all survive as table
values. The bound and the `0` of the range guard are additions, which the guard reports and
allows.

---

## Recipe J - Dispatch Table

**Use when:** CodeScene reports *Overall Code Complexity* or *Code Duplication* on a file
whose functions are all one `switch` whose every arm is a single **call**. Recipe L does
this for arms that return a constant; this is the same transformation for arms that call
something. A switch like that is a dispatch table written as control flow, and the whole
file's complexity is the arm count.

**The conditions, all five:**

1. Every non-default arm is exactly one call statement followed by `break;`. No second
   statement, no fallthrough, no arm that falls into the next.
2. No argument list anywhere in the switch contains a call, an assignment, an increment,
   or anything else with an effect. The table builds every step's arguments on entry, not
   only the selected one's, so the arguments must be pure - literals, parameters, or
   compound literals of those. Check this over the whole family before converting any of
   it, not arm by arm.
3. The case labels are unique and ascending, and the controlling expression is a plain
   integer or enum value.
4. The switch has a `default:`, and it too is a single statement.
5. The callees are declared in one header, so their signatures - and therefore the
   argument structs and the adapters - can be generated rather than typed.

**How:**

1. Generate one argument struct per callee, its fields in the callee's parameter order
   and with the callee's own parameter types, and one adapter per callee that unpacks
   the struct into the call. A callee that already takes one of the engine's argument
   objects gets a typedef of that object instead, so its steps read like every other
   step's. `tools/pattern_table.py --emit-infra` does this from `com_sub.h`.
2. Write one interpreter: index the table with the switch's controlling expression,
   fall through to the default arm when the index is past the end or lands on a hole.
3. Replace each function body with the table, **keyed by designated initialisers whose
   subscripts are the case labels**, and a call to the interpreter.

**Before:**

```c
void pattern_approach_walk_em_term_normal_attack(PLW* wk, s16 target_pos, const EM_Term_Params* p) {
    switch (CP_Index[wk->wu.id][0]) {
    case 0:
        Approach_Walk(wk, target_pos, 2);
        break;

    case 1:
        EM_Term(wk, p);
        break;

    case 2:
        Normal_Attack(wk, 8, 0x402);
        break;

    default:
        End_Pattern(wk);
        break;
    }
}
```

**After:**

```c
void pattern_approach_walk_em_term_normal_attack(PLW* wk, s16 target_pos, const EM_Term_Params* p) {
    const Pattern_Step script[3] = { [0] = STEP(Approach_Walk, target_pos, 2),
                                     [1] = STEP_WITH(EM_Term, p),
                                     [2] = STEP(Normal_Attack, 8, 0x402) };
    Run_Pattern(wk, script, 3);
}
```

**Why the designators.** They are the case labels, unchanged. *Absolutely forbidden* calls
a `case` label a literal and renumbering it a literal change, and it is right: a positional
array would silently renumber every arm of a switch that does not start at zero. Eight of
this folder's skeletons start at `case 6:`, and they convert to `[6] = ...` in a table of
seven with six holes, which is what the switch did.

**Why the inverse is the proof.** The transformation is invertible, and the tool runs it
backwards: `--verify` parses a converted file, regenerates the switch from its tables, and
diffs that against the pre-conversion source. An exact match says no call, no argument and
no step number moved. That is what has to carry a 448-function change here, because
statcheck is unavailable and replay verification excludes CPU AI by design
(`REPLAY-VERIFICATION.md`). Do not apply this recipe by hand to more than one function:
if it cannot be scripted, it cannot be verified, and the recipe does not apply.

`refactor_guard.py` knows about this. Compared raw, a converted file looks like a
substitution on every function - the case labels stop being literals and the step count
starts being one - so the guard inverts a Recipe J file before counting, and still sees
any value that really changed.

**What it is worth.** `Game/com/patterns`, fourteen files and 448 skeletons, went from a
mean of **8.02 to 9.73**, eleven of the fourteen reaching 10.00. *Overall Code Complexity*
cleared on all of them - a file of switches has its mean cyclomatic complexity pinned at
its arm count, and a file of tables has it at one.

**The line budget, measured.** What decides whether *Code Duplication* clears is physical
lines. CodeScene groups functions of **ten lines or more** by shape; nine lines is clear.
Bisected on a synthetic file of thirty same-shaped functions: five table lines scored
10.00, six scored 8.03. A converted function measures

    signature (1, or 3 when it wraps past the column limit) + steps + 1 + 1

so a skeleton of six steps and a one-line signature comes in at nine, and the same
skeleton with a wrapped signature does not. Write the table without a trailing comma so
clang-format packs it, and spell a step `STEP(Call, values...)` rather than
`{ Step_Call, &(const Call_Step) { values } }`: the short notation is what brings the
six-step file under the floor. This is a fact about the measurement and it is written down
so the next plateau can be priced, not an invitation to shorten names or widen
`ColumnLimit` to buy a line. See *Where `Game/com/patterns` stopped* in `BACKLOG.md`.

## Recipe K - Check List

**Use when:** a function is nothing but a run of guards that all have the same shape -

```c
void nm_state(PLW *wk) {
    if (first_check(wk))  { return; }
    if (second_check(wk)) { return; }
    if (third_check(wk))  { return; }
    last_thing(wk);
}
```

\- and CodeScene reports *Code Duplication* across several such functions. They are a
list written as control flow. Recipe D refuses them because they differ in more than one
check; Recipe C finds no identical run because each picks its own checks in its own order;
Recipe F cannot help because there is nothing in common to parameterise except the shape
itself.

Measured on `pls00_normal_states.c`, where CodeScene read six states plus three
attack-check helpers as one web: **8.03 -> 10.00** over four commits.

**The conditions:**

1. Every guard is `if (<call>(x)) { return <constant or nothing>; }` over the *same* single
   argument. No other statements between the guards.
2. The function ends in a plain `return <constant>` or falls off the end, and may end in
   one unguarded call - see below.
3. Every listed function can be reached through one function-pointer type. Where it cannot,
   it gets an adapter; see *The adapters*.

**How:**

1. Name the pointer type once, next to the states that use it, and write the scan:

   ```c
   typedef s32 (*NmStateCheck)(PLW *wk);

   static s32 run_nm_state_checks(PLW *wk, const NmStateCheck *checks) {
       s32 i;

       for (i = 0; checks[i] != NULL; i++) {
           if (checks[i](wk)) {
               return 1;
           }
       }

       return 0;
   }
   ```

2. Each function becomes its own table and one call:

   ```c
   void nm_state(PLW *wk) {
       static const NmStateCheck checks[] = { first_check, second_check, third_check,
                                              last_thing_adapter, NULL };

       run_nm_state_checks(wk, checks);
   }
   ```

**The last call.** A trailing unguarded call joins the table like any other entry. Testing
its result and returning changes nothing, because nothing followed it. A trailing call that
returns `void` needs an adapter that returns 0.

**The adapters.** This is where the recipe is easy to get wrong. C decompilations are full
of check functions reporting `s32`, `s16` and `bool` interchangeably, and **calling a
`bool (*)(PLW *)` through an `s32 (*)(PLW *)` is undefined behaviour** - not a warning, and
not something the build will catch. Every check whose type is not the table's type gets a
three-line adapter:

```c
static s32 nm_check_f_r_walk(PLW *wk) {
    return check_F_R_walk(wk);
}
```

The same adapter form carries a call with a fixed extra argument
(`check_full_gauge_attack(wk, 0)`), a call guarded by something else
(`if (ArcadeBalance_IsEnabled())`, returning 0 where the guard fails), and a nested pair of
guards. **Each adapter returns the value its own `if` tested**, so nothing is converted that
was not already being converted at that `if`.

Adapters are three or four lines, under the duplication check's ten-line floor, so they do
not become a new finding. A *pair* of adapters that grows past that does: on
`pls00_normal_states.c` the two lever-guarded ones were a duplicate pair on their own until
the guard itself became a helper taking the list to run, which is worth 0.27.

**What it costs.** One function-pointer indirection per check, in the fight loop. That is
the same cost Recipe F already pays, and the same argument applies: it is a jump through a
table rather than a direct call, in code that is doing a state transition.

**What `refactor_guard.py` sees.** Nothing removed and nothing substituted: the checks were
names, not constants. The `NULL` terminator is not a number, and the scan's `0` and `1` are
the values the lists already returned.

---

## Recipe A - Parameter Object

**Use when:** CodeScene reports *Excess Number of Function Arguments* (more than four for
C). No other recipe reaches this smell, and on the Term families it was the only thing
standing between the file and a clean review.

**Authorised by the project owner on 2026-09-15**, including on public signatures, in the
knowledge that it can mean rewriting thousands of call sites in the character scripts.
That is mechanical, but it is not small: `Command_Attack` alone has 1,658 call sites.

**How:**

1. Declare a `struct` whose fields are the function's parameters, **in the same order**
   and with **exactly the same types**. Name it for the family, not the function.
2. Change the function to take one `const Struct*`, and read each parameter as a field.
   Pass the same pointer on to any helper that only ever ran on those values.
3. Rewrite every call site to pass its **original argument list** through a compound
   literal: `f(wk, &(Args){8, 0, 0x30, -1});`. Do not reorder, reformat or "clean up" the
   arguments while you are in there.
4. Declare the struct in the header the callers already include, beside the function.

**Preconditions - all of them:**

- Two functions share a struct **only** if their parameter lists match in order *and* in
  type. One signed-versus-unsigned field is enough to require two structs; merging them
  would be a type change, which is forbidden.
- Where two families need the same subset of values - approach gates, a landing step -
  give that subset its own small struct and build it at the call site from fields the
  caller already holds. Do not widen one family's struct to serve another.
- Check that the function is never referenced other than as a direct call. A name that
  appears in a function-pointer table cannot take a new signature.
- `refactor_guard.py` must report **OK** on every changed file - not WARN. The argument
  lists are copied verbatim, so the literal fingerprint cannot move. A WARN here means the
  rewrite touched something it should not have.

**Scriptable, and worth scripting.** A regex over `name(wk, <args>);` that wraps the
argument list is reliable *if* it also asserts, per file, that the number of matches
equals the number of occurrences of `name(wk,` - that catches a call split over two lines,
which the regex would silently miss - and that every call has the expected argument count.

---

## Recipe S - Split File

**Use when:** CodeScene reports *Lines of Code in a Single File*.

**This is the last recipe you apply, never the first.** Reduce function complexity first;
the file often drops out of the Red band without needing a split at all.

**How:**

1. Group functions that share a `static` variable or an obvious theme.
2. Move that group to a new `.c` file beside the original.
3. Add a matching `.h` **only** for functions used from outside the new file.
4. The build globs sources, so no CMake edit is needed - but re-run `cmake --build build`
   and confirm the link step succeeds.

Do not split a file if it would require making a `static` function non-`static`. Widening
linkage is a behaviour change in the sense that matters here: it changes what the rest of
the program can reach.

**One exception, added 2026-09-18** under the project owner's standing authorisation, and
measured on `appear.c`: **a helper this campaign itself created may cross the cut.**

The rule above protects the *decompiled program*. Its reason - "it changes what the rest of
the program can reach" - is a statement about code that was there before the campaign
started. A `static` helper introduced by a Recipe D, C or E commit was not there. It is, by
construction, a verbatim copy of lines that were already inline at every one of its call
sites, so giving it external linkage exposes nothing the original program did not already
execute at each of those points.

`appear.c` is the case that forced it. Its first two commits pulled twenty-five copies of
the appear-finished handover into `mark_appear_finished` and eighteen copies of the
last-frame test into `finish_appear_on_last_frame`, worth **3.56 -> 4.33** between them.
Those two helpers are then called from both halves of any cut you can make, so Recipe S as
written forbade the split that the file needed - and needed badly: at 1593 lines it was in
the regime below where extraction stops paying. The split measured **6.02 -> 7.50** for
`appear.c` with `appear_late.c` arriving at 7.95.

**Preconditions, all of them:**

- **The helper must have been created by this campaign**, in a commit on this branch, and
  its body must still be the verbatim block it was extracted from. Check the commit that
  introduced it. If you cannot point at that commit, the helper is not yours and this
  exception does not apply.
- **No original `static` is widened.** In `appear.c`, `gill_appear_check` and
  `sean_appear_check` keep exactly the linkage the decompilation gave them. If the split
  also needs one of those, the split is refused - move the group that does not, or leave
  the file alone.
- **The helper is declared in the header the two halves already share**, beside the
  functions it sits among. Do not invent a third "common" file to hold it.
- **The group check must come back clean on both runs.** `--combined` and `--calls
  --combined` over the whole split group; on `appear.c` both returned `OK`, 1564 literals
  and 371 call sites unchanged. A `--calls` group result that is anything other than `OK`
  means a call moved rather than travelled, and the split is wrong.

What does *not* relax: this licenses a **linkage** change on a campaign-created helper and
nothing else. It does not license renaming an original function, moving one between files
under a new name, or widening an original `static` because the split would be tidier.

---

## Recipe R - Resolve a Goto Chain

**Use when:** CodeScene reports *Complex Method* on a function whose complexity is mostly
`goto`. CodeScene counts each `goto` as a branch, so a function built from a chain of
`if (...) goto label;` scores roughly twice its apparent complexity and no other recipe in
this catalogue reaches it - E, G, X and P all leave the jumps exactly where they were.

This shape is common in the decompiled code: the Ghidra output for a chain of early
returns comes back as a chain of jumps to labels that each return.

**Added 2026-09-17** under the project owner's standing authorisation to write new recipes
when a transformation is behaviour-preserving by construction.

**How:**

1. Check the preconditions below. If any of them fails, stop - this is not the shape.
2. Replace each `goto L;` with a **verbatim copy** of the `return` statement that stands
   under `L`. Character for character: the same expression, the same subscripts, the same
   casts.
3. Delete every label that is now unreferenced, together with the return beneath it.
4. The one label that was also reachable by falling off the end of the code above keeps
   its return, unlabelled, as the function's tail.

**Preconditions, all of them:**

- **Every label in the chain ends in an unconditional transfer** - a `return`, or a
  `break` that leaves the enclosing loop or switch - and holds nothing after it. The
  common case is a label holding exactly one `return`; a label holding a short fixed
  sequence that *ends* in the transfer is the same shape and is allowed, but keep the
  sequence to one or two statements, or extract it (Recipe E) before applying this one so
  the copies do not become a duplication finding of their own.
- **No label can be reached by falling into it.** Each label is entered only by its
  `goto`s, or by falling off the end of the code above into the *first* of them. If
  control can fall from one label's body into the next, the chain encodes an order and
  deleting it changes behaviour.
- **Every `goto` jumps forward, and stays inside the same construct.** A backward jump is
  a loop and is out of scope; a jump that leaves a loop or switch is not a transfer this
  recipe can copy.
- **The conditions are not touched.** The `if`s keep their operators, their operands and
  their order; only the jump becomes the statements it jumped to.
- **Nothing else in the function references the labels.**

**Before:**

```c
u8 pick_row(Work *w, s16 ix) {
    if (w->missed)      goto miss;
    if (w->flags & 3)   goto hit;
    if (w->flags & 0xC0) goto block;
miss:
    return miss_table[w->id][ix];
hit:
    return hit_table[w->id][ix];
block:
    return block_table[w->id][ix];
}
```

**After:**

```c
u8 pick_row(Work *w, s16 ix) {
    if (w->missed) {
        return miss_table[w->id][ix];
    }

    if (w->flags & 3) {
        return hit_table[w->id][ix];
    }

    if (w->flags & 0xC0) {
        return block_table[w->id][ix];
    }

    return miss_table[w->id][ix];
}
```

Note the tail: the original fell off the last `if` into `miss:`, so the miss row is
returned twice and that repetition is correct. Do not "tidy" it by reordering the tests to
avoid it - that would reorder the conditions, which is forbidden.

**What the guard shows.** Literals are **added, none removed** - the copied return brings
its own subscripts - and `--calls` is unchanged, because a table subscript is not a call.
A removed literal here means a return was rewritten rather than copied, and that is a FAIL.

**This is control flow.** Like Recipe F, a Recipe R commit belongs in the genuinely
high-risk tier of the verification loop: run `tools/replay_verify.sh` on it.

## Known plateaus

A plateau is a result, not a failure: the point where no legal recipe raises the score
further. Record it in the task report with the reason, so the next agent does not spend a
session rediscovering it.

Every plateau found so far has the same cause - duplication between sibling state machines
that differ in more than one value, or only in their state numbering, which Recipe D and
Recipe X both refuse to merge.

| File | Plateau | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mtrans.c` | 7.55 | *was 2.57 at campaign start, 5.24 at the start of the rendering wave.* What remains is two findings. **Code Duplication** is a web of 16/32 and cached/new/plain near-misses in the nine `store_*` tile passes, each differing in several places at once - the cache lookup, the palette argument and the attribute expression - so Recipe D, F and W all refuse them; `lz_ext_p6_fx` against `lz_ext_p6_cx` and `get_mltbuf16` against `get_mltbuf32` differ in a pointer type, which is a type change. **Lines of Code in a Single File** stands at 1205 and no further legal cut exists: a call-graph pass over the 47 statics shows `advance_trans_x`/`_y` with eleven callers, the six `get_mltbuf*` with three each, and `lz_ext_p6_fx` shared between the tile passes and the melt pass, so every seam the duplication groups suggest runs through a static that Recipe S forbids widening. Splitting out `getObjectHeight`, `mlt_obj_matrix` and `draw_box` was measured - 1272 -> 1205 lines, still flagged, nothing cleared - and reverted under rule 2 |
| `bg.c` | 9.09 | *was 3.62 at campaign start, 7.32 at the start of the stage wave.* Recipe A fourteen times cleared Excess Number of Function Arguments, Recipe S took the texture loading to `bg_textures.c`, and Recipes D, F and N took the reachable duplication. What remains is four chip-remap scanners: `remap_stage19_default_chip` against `remap_stage03_background_chip` differ in their limit *and* in a `*vtxColor` write that only happens on a match, so it cannot travel to the call site and a helper returning both a remapped index and a match verdict is two results; `remap_stage03_player_chip` differs in its key *and* its value, both indexed by the loop variable. A second Recipe S split is blocked by construction, verified against the call graph rather than argued: `draw_remapped_tiles` is called by `draw_stage19_tiles` and both ending drawers, and `draw_chip_and_restore_list` by the stage-02, stage-03 and shared passes, so every placement of an ending/stage line widens at least one `static` |
| `bg_textures.c` | **10.00** | split from `bg.c`. Recipe D on the rewrite slot load *then* Recipe X on the two special-stage arms - see *Share the run before splitting the shape* |
| `bg_sub.c` | 9.09 | *was 7.38.* Three Bumpy Roads cleared with Recipes C and E, four dedups, then Recipe S for `bg_zoom.c`. Three mirrored x/y pairs remain: `scr_11_22`/`scr_12_21` swap the player indices in three places, `scr_11_21`/`scr_12_22` differ in `<` against `>` and `-` against `+`, and the two chase start checks differ in five names and two callees |
| `bg_zoom.c` | **8.81** | *was 7.38 in `bg_sub.c`, then 8.54.* The axis split stays refused, and for a better reason than the `static`: it separates `select_horizontal_zoom_request` and `select_vertical_zoom_request`, a flagged duplication pair, into two files. Naming the two fighter midpoints instead removes the duplicate text and measures 8.54 -> 8.81. Overall Code Complexity does not clear: the mean is 4.17 over 18 functions against a threshold of 4, and the third function needed would be padding. Naming the fighter *position* accessor, 17 sites, measures 8.81 -> 8.54 |
| `bonus_bg.c` | **10.00** | *was 9.38.* A **two-instance** family differing in two literals - the case Recipe V refuses - cleared by Recipe C on the run the two inits end with, without relaxing the three-instance rule |
| `bg000.c` | **10.00** | *was 9.92, and was wrongly recorded as a plateau.* The two demo arms differ in `+=` against `-=` and `>` against `<`, so splitting them alone costs 0.54; sharing the settle block they both end with is flat alone. Dedup first, then split, is worth 0.08 - see *Share the run before splitting the shape* |
| `ta_sub.c`, `bg090.c` | **10.00** | *both were 9.38.* One Recipe D and one Recipe E respectively |
| `mtrans_pool.c` | 9.38 | `collect_used_x16_tile_row` against its 32 twin: they differ in the map array's element type, in the operand order of the bit test, in both loop bounds and in the index arithmetic |
| `com_sub_air_term.c` | 9.68 | `ORO_JA_Term` at cc 9; clearing it makes a twin of `ORO_HJA_Term_Airborne` and costs 0.87 |
| `com_sub_attack.c` | 9.09 | the two normal-attack wind-ups differ in two statements |
| `com_sub_command_term.c` | 9.09 | two pairs of airborne twins, one state number apart |
| `eff09.c` | 8.54 | see *The eff09 family* below |
| `eff09_endgame.c`, `eff09_late.c` | 9.38 | see *The eff09 family* below |
| `eff02.c` | 9.06 | near-miss siblings |
| `eff55.c` | 9.42 | the rise and the fall differ in three values; splitting the states exposes it, -0.33 |
| `eff68.c` | 9.09 | five waypoint steps differing in their timers and targets; sharing their identical runs leaves the smell unmoved |
| `eff78.c` | 9.55 | `crow_flap` and `crow_take_off` differ in five values; splitting `crow_fuss_move` exposes it, -0.17 |
| `grade.c` | **10.00** | *was 8.67.* The table-scan idiom below, cleared by Recipe T: the seventeen scans share one loop and each call site keeps its own table, bound and value. The last finding, `makeup_spp_frdat`, was an ordinary Recipe E |
| `pls03.c` | 8.92 | *was 8.08.* Recipe T twice, Recipe E on the leap and catch tests, then two shared runs for the mean. `decode_wst_data`'s twelve encodings and `waza_select`'s eleven case labels are what remain, and neither loses a branch without renumbering states |
| `cmd_main_checks.c` | 7.50 | The hardest file left. Its mean is 4.34 over 64 functions and needs **thirteen** more, which is far more than the duplicate web can absorb - every arm lifted joins one of three families. Sharing the runs was tried too (`load_waza_command_header`, `command_terminator_reached`) and measured flat, because the findings here are five Bumpy Roads and three Complex Methods rather than the mean alone |
| `pls00_normal_states.c` | 8.03 | *was 7.55.* Five shared runs - the two end-of-animation markers, the entry-frame guard, and the two jump hand-overs - cleared Overall Code Complexity. What is left is a Code Duplication web between the state machines themselves, which no run reaches: sharing the two arms `jumping_cg_type_low_pat` and `jumping_cg_type_high_pat` agree on (Recipe X's variant) measured flat, and the gate chains differ in their members and their order |
| `game_state.c`, `game_state_load.c` | **10.00** each | *both were 7.26.* 569 `GS_SAVE`/`GS_LOAD` lines in one function apiece, split thirteen ways on the module comments the tail already carried and on changes of subject in the head. The cuts are positional and the commit says so. Verified past the usual three: the member sequence extracted as a list is identical in order on both sides and between them, and `replay_verify.sh` ran 16 seeds x 2400 frames identical - the stress harness saves and restores this state every frame, so it exercises these two functions directly |
| `game_round.c` | **10.00** | *was 7.23.* Ten commits of Recipes E and X over the post-match and game-over flow. The last two are a deliberate pair: with Overall Code Complexity the only finding left and the file mean just over 4, a probe said **two** more low-complexity functions would clear it, so the first of the two measures flat and says in its message that the second carries it |
| `test_runner.c` | **10.00** | *was 7.92.* Recipe E, Recipe P, then Recipe V twice on the two input bit maps - see the Recipe V amendment above - and Recipe X on the phase dispatch, cut where it is because `PHASE_GAME_TRANSITION` falls through into `PHASE_GAME` |
| `arcade_char_data.c` | **9.92** | *was 7.37, then 9.53 - and that note is overturned.* It read that `read_script` cannot leave Complex Method because three of its ten branches are the `||`s inside an `SDL_assert` and Recipe P cannot reach them. Recipe E does not name the assertion, it carries it into a header helper, and the branches leave with it: cc 9 -> 5, **9.61 -> 9.92**. Bumpy Road remains - lifting the cg-entry arm needs five arguments against a threshold of four. See *Recipe E reaches the branches Recipe P cannot name* |
| `cmd_main_checks.c` | 9.16 | *was 7.50, and was recorded as a plateau.* Overturned twice over - see *A plateau note covers the functions it names* and *Retry a rejected extraction - including one refused on duplication*. What remains is the `check_10`/`check_12` near-twin pair, re-priced and still costing 0.73 to break |
| `flps2vram.c` | 8.54 | *was 7.36.* Recipe C on the three pixel layouts, then Recipe D on the context set-ups that fold made visible. What remains is four mirrored texture/palette pairs differing in two to four values each, and the three layout helpers, whose fold costs |
| `emlShim.c` | **9.68** | *was 7.46, then 8.94.* `checkConditions` at cc 17 still does not yield to Recipe X at any chain depth. The 8.94 note did not cover the two cc-9 functions below it: moving `checkOneIdCondition`'s guid and bank arms behind a new `default` measures 9.50 -> 9.68. A **second** link for `checkOneCondition` clears Complex Method outright and measures 9.38 - see *One new link in a dispatch chain is free, the second twins*. Clearing it by deleting the empty `MATCH_UNK` arm is refused: it names an enumerator |
| `memmgr.c` | 8.64 | *was 7.58.* Recipe D twice and Recipe A once. `plmemAppendBlockList` is what remains: its two direction branches are twins differing in `<` against `>`, and each writes **three** outer locals - `now_han`, `next_han` and `now_block` - so Recipe E refuses them and there is no single result to return |
| `prilay.c` | **10.00** | *was 7.60.* Recipe E on both pixel paths, Recipe P on the bounds test, then Recipe E on the two 4-bit cases. The last step is the one worth copying: both halves of a mirrored pair were extracted and it measured **+0.76 with no twin penalty**, because a writer that composes a byte and a reader that selects a nibble are not similar enough to pair |
| `args.c`, `spu.c`, `savesub.c` | **10.00** each | *were 8.74, 8.41 and 8.36.* `args.c` is Recipe P six times then Recipe E three times; `spu.c` is Recipe P on the two envelope tests then Recipe E twice; `savesub.c`'s `SAVE_STATE_WORKING` arm turned out to be entirely self-contained, so its helper takes **no parameters at all** |
| `ioconv.c` | 9.92 | *was 8.68.* Recipe N on the three switch-table scans, Recipe D on the two analog merges, Recipe P three times, Recipe E once. What is left is two bumps in `keyConvert` that do not move: lifting the repeat-rate block measures flat and was reverted |
| `demo00.c`, `demo02.c` | 9.38 each | *were 8.38 and 8.42.* Recipe A, Recipe X and Recipe X chained twice. `demo02.c`'s last bump is `demo00_from_step_5`, and lifting its demo-finish block costs **0.50** - the helper twins with something. `demo00.c`'s mean was recorded as far enough over 4 that six probe functions do not clear it, which is **wrong - corrected 2026-09-20**: `tools/mean_probe.py` closes it on four and the file reaches 10.00 |
| `sc_sub_combo.c` | 9.38 | *was 8.56.* Both player-side pairs split - and player one's side alone measured **worse than doing nothing**, 8.56 -> 8.18, because the helper carries that side's whole complexity out of a function that stays flagged anyway. Both is what pays |
| `sys_sub_ranking.c` | 9.38 | *was 8.54.* Recipe V on the insert three of the four ranking tables share. `Check_Sort_Score` is left out: its table starts at zero and is written without a `+ 0` to parameterise |
| `Lz77Dec.c` | 8.79 | *was 8.33.* Recipe E cannot touch `decLZ77withSizeCheck` at all - every block in it advances `src`, `dst` and `size` at once, and a cursor struct is the out-parameter object Recipe E forbids inventing. Recipe D reaches the four families inside it that each produce one value; the three literal-copy loops that would come next advance **two** pointers and stay |
| `pulpul.c` | 8.73 | *was 8.22.* `run_pulpul_device` keeps three findings and cannot lose them: its state machine falls through on every arm, so Recipe X cannot cut it, and it contains a **backward** `goto` that Recipe R does not reach either |
| `opening_bg0.c` | **10.00** | *was 8.12, and was recorded here as "a family plateau, measured twice".* Overturned - see *Price the file's cheapest finding before inheriting a plateau*. Overall Code Complexity clears on two more low-complexity functions, and once it has, both moves the old note rejected are worth taking. Two of the green-band pass's measurements survive the overturn and are the reason it is nine commits rather than three: **moving the `0x4B` arm up the chain costs 0.09, because that arm was the only thing making `_6` unlike `_4`** - move a plain `oh_bg_blk_w_rows` arm instead and the same rebalance pays **+0.16**; and Recipe C on the run `op_bg0_0010` and `op_bg0_0012` share is flat on score while `op_bg0_0010` leaves the duplication group, which is how the category was worn down rather than cleared in one move |
| `sdl_gpu_renderer.c` | **10.00** | *was 6.82.* Recipe E eight times and two parameter objects, in that order: the frame's phases, the per-quad pipeline choice, the six set-up sections, `create_shader` and `create_pipeline`'s argument lists, the three remaining set-up blocks, the screen pass's bindings |
| `flps2etc.c` | 9.84 | *was 6.94.* Recipes E, G and P over the four image loaders. What remains is the two PIC row decoders at two bumps each: the third arm of each run-length form advances **both** the source and the destination inside its loop, so lifting it is a block writing two outer locals, which Recipe E refuses |
| `pltim2.c` | 9.38 | *was 7.21.* Recipe P on the header checks, Recipe D on the pixel-format blocks the two context setters share, Recipe E and Recipe X on the rest. The four format helpers are one Code Duplication group, and folding them onto one parameter object measures **8.77 -> 8.77** - it clears the duplication and brings Overall Code Complexity straight back, because three of the functions it removes are cc 1. See *A fold that removes simple functions can push the file mean over its threshold*, measured again |
| `ps2PAD.c` | **9.92** | *was 7.01, then 9.29.* Recipes D and E over the read path. `PADRead_for_PS2` cannot leave Complex Method: seven of its eleven branches are the six grouped `case` labels of the pad-kind switch plus its `default`, all running one arm, and collapsing them is renumbering. Recipe C on the report test both `pad_reported` arms end with took 9.84 -> 9.92. `flPADShockSet`'s two arms each write three locals - `profile`, `vib_data_size` and `vib_data` - so Recipe E refuses them |
| `Game/com/shell` | **10.00** x10 | *was 8.28-8.81.* The third COM script folder, never folded. `xfold` put 32 scripts onto skeletons earlier folds had already made, and `gfold --min-members 2` took the other 84 onto nine new ones. See *A third script folder, and the fold that reaches an existing skeleton* |
| `Game/com/patterns` | 8.02 mean | the shared skeleton module, 14 files. Two findings, both intrinsic to the idiom and both priced mechanically - see *Where `Game/com/patterns` stops, against the published thresholds* |
| `plpnm.c` | 7.52 | what is left of the 28-function group are state machines differing in two or more values; the two parry states keep Duff-style `case` arms that cannot be split |
| `pls03_super_arts.c` | 9.92 | *was 7.61.* Recipe C on the full-gauge guards and the EX strength launch, Recipe D on the super-art launch tail, Recipe F on the EX strength scan, and the airborne EX guard chain the table had previously recorded at -0.23. `try_grounded_dc_strengths`' Bumpy Road is what remains, and the direct-cancel side is a grounded/airborne mirror **at every level**: lifting its match body makes three twin pairs at once - the two `fire_*_dc`, the two `try_*_dc_strengths` and the two `try_*_dc` - and measures 9.92 -> 9.09. Breaking the outermost pair first with Recipe P on the button-group test does not change that |
| `manage.c` | 9.92 | `Game_Manage_7_3`'s two identical test arms; clearing the bump means deleting the dead condition, which the catalogue forbids |
| `plcnt3.c` | **10.00** | *was 9.50.* Recipe D on the two push-out requests and Recipe P on the two both-players waits, measured as a set |
| `plmain2.c` | **10.00** | *was 9.68.* Recipe E on the bonus-game placement. Extracting the other candidate block instead measures 9.38 - it twins with `plmv_b_1010` |
| `stun.c` | **10.00** | *was 9.53.* Three extractions measured as a set (Recipe E twice, Recipe D once), then one more Recipe D for the redraw |
| `eff93.c` | 9.38 | the two slide-outs differ only in a comparison operator, which may not be parameterised |
| `effa2.c` | 9.34 | every state returns past a shared tail, so no state can move to a helper without a 0/1 protocol per arm |
| `effa9.c` | 9.16 | near-miss siblings |
| `effb5.c` | 9.58 | `goto case_1` jumps from state 2 into the middle of state 1 |
| `effd1.c` | 9.92 | `fall_data_set`'s two mirrored aiming arms - see the rule below |
| `effe9.c` | 9.92 | `effe9_panel_shape`'s two mirrored arms - see the rule below |
| `eff09_init.c` | 9.68 | ten case labels left after one split; a second split makes three dispatchers that read as duplicates, -0.30 |
| `eff11.c` | 9.13 | near-miss siblings |
| `effg6.c`, `eff00.c` | 9.21-9.22 | near-miss siblings |
| `effect.c` | **10.00** | *was 9.38.* The four mirrored list walks, in three Recipe E steps: the two kill loops, the two push loops, then the backward arm of `search_effect_index` **and only that arm**. Extracting both arms of the last measures 9.09 and drags the four helpers the first two commits added into the duplication group with it |
| `efff6.c` | 9.09 | near-miss siblings |
| `effm2.c` | 9.53 | the two cat routines' dispatchers read as duplicates once their states are named |
| `plcnt.c` | **10.00** | *was 9.47.* Recipe X on the victory pause and Recipe P on the hit-state pair cleared both Complex Methods and pushed the file over 1000 lines; Recipe S split the per-player setup into `plcnt_setup.c` |
| `plcnt_setup.c` | 9.38 | split from `plcnt.c`. Recipe C took the run both super-art setups open with; `remake_sa_store_max` and `remake_sa_gauge_len` remain, differing in the table, the index, a multiplier, the clamp bounds - and in `<=` against `<`, which may never be parameterised |
| `pls02.c` | **10.00** | *was 9.31.* Recipe R on `check_body_touch2`'s goto chain, Recipe E to lift the bonus-car block out of its nesting, then Recipe C on the latent `store_mvxy_x_from` twin - which is what finally made the wall-side split and the `while (1)` removal pay. See *An arm that ends in `break` inside a `while (1)`* for the ledger |
| `charset_position.c` | **10.00** | *was 9.09.* Recipe F merged the two `pa` axes through the `koc` skeleton; naming `comm_ps_x`'s one-line position set (Recipe E) is what stopped it reading as a copy of `set_other_y`, and the `rv` pair fell out with it |
| `plpdm_states.c` | **10.00** | *was 9.38.* Six shared runs, no arm lifted - see *Against a twin family, share what they agree on* |
| `plpdm_states_late.c` | **10.00** | *was 9.38.* Three shared runs and one ordinary extraction |
| `caldir.c` | 8.81 | Two findings, both immovable from inside the engine folder. **Excess Number of Function Arguments**: `cal_all_speed_data` and `cal_delta_speed` take 6 each, and Recipe A would clear it - but their call sites are spread across the effect and animation folders, not just the engine one, so the rewrite leaves this branch's scope. (An earlier note blamed a single call site in `plpat00.c`; that was too narrow - the real count is 62 across three folders.) **Code Duplication**: three x/y mirror pairs, each differing in five field names and a callee, which no recipe reaches - see *Two mirrored arms are cheaper left together* |
| `charset.c` | 9.68 | `set_char_move_init2` takes 5 arguments; same shape as `caldir.c` and the same reason, measured properly this time: **155** call sites, 111 of them in the effect folder and 13 in animation. Recipe A here is an effect-folder change wearing an engine-folder hat |
| `plpat.c` | **10.00** | *was 6.15.* Five extractions and three dedups cleared every function, then Recipe S moved the jump-attack dummy-RTNM group to `plpat_ja.c` to bring the 42-function mean down |
| `plpat_ja.c` | **10.00** | split from `plpat.c`. `get_cjdR`'s goto chain was the last Complex Method and the reason **Recipe R** exists; the nine rno-mapping arms then went behind one Recipe D helper, whose cc of 1 is what took the mean under the threshold |
| `plpat19.c` | **10.00** | *was 7.14.* Three Recipe D/C passes over the shared flight and marker blocks, then arm extractions, then three more for the mean |
| `plpatuni.c` | **10.00** | *was 7.37.* See *Choose which arms to extract so no two dispatchers end up bare* - the seven-extraction set scored 9.09, the same set minus two scored 10.00 |
| `plpat09.c` | 9.92 | *was 8.36.* Sharing `set_tenguiwa`'s two rock placements (Recipe T) instead of splitting them, Recipe A on the resulting five arguments, four more functions for the mean, then one arm of `homing_target_x`. What is left is `place_tenguiwa_set`'s shell loop, whose two bumps are its `continue` guard and its body - merging them needs `<` to become `>=` |
| `plpat17.c` | **10.00** | *was 8.17.* Recipe D on AT1's repeated markers, then all six of its arms, then the taunt's and finally Recipe P on the bonus-car test |
| `plpat14.c` | **10.00** | *was 8.75.* Arm extractions on all four attacks; the twin AT3 exposed was closed by Recipe D on the tail the union leg and the regrab share |
| `plpat07.c` | **10.00** | *was 9.38.* One shared opening changed the count of arms needed from five to four, and four could be chosen to miss the twins |
| `plpat20.c` | **10.00** | *was 8.93.* AT1 and AT3 turned out to share two arms outright, not as near misses; after Recipe D on those, arm extractions cleared the rest |
| `plpat06.c` | **10.00** | *was 9.11.* The run and throw marker switches are the case Recipe X's shared-arm variant was written for - see the recipe |
| `plmain.c` | **10.00** | *was 9.38.* Three Recipe S splits, then the extractions that had measured flat before them - see *A file can be too big for its own mean* below. 1430 lines and 65 functions became 606 and 35, plus `plmain_arts.c`, `plmain_ps2_arts.c` and `plmain_vital.c`, all at 10.00 |
| `plmain_arts.c` | **10.00** | split from `plmain.c`. Almost any pair of helpers named out of its gauge state machines reads as a duplicate: naming `mpg_union`'s arms twins it with `eag_union`, and naming `spend_max_gauge`'s firing arm twins it with `spend_and_disarm_ex`, both -0.57. What paid was Recipe C, which removes a run instead of naming an arm |
| `hitplpl.c` | 8.59 | `player_at_vs_player_dm` is one `while (1)` whose arms leave through `break` and `goto two`; no arm can move to a helper without a numeric verdict protocol |
| `cmd_main.c` | **9.68** | *was 9.39, and the note is refined rather than overturned.* It read that splitting each of `latch_sw_lvbt_bit_0x80` and `_0x800` trades Complex Method for a Code Duplication pair at no net gain, which is true of splitting **both**: Recipe P on both measures 9.38. On **one** it measures 9.68, because a single predicate twins with nothing. The other keeps its two switches |
| `cmb_win.c` | **10.00** | *was 9.92.* Recipe F: two of the three passes over the players differed only in what they called |
| `plpdm.c` | **10.00** | *was 9.61.* Recipe X on the rumble suppression list, then Recipe E on the death conversion |
| `bbbscom.c` | **10.00** | *was 9.38.* Overall Code Complexity only, and two Recipe E extractions cleared it - the file has 15 functions, so the mean moves at once. Compare `plmain.c` above, where 65 functions make the same move worthless |
| `manage_result.c` | **10.00** | *was 9.38.* One Recipe D on `BGM_Control`'s two waits, for the same reason |
| `entry.c` | **10.00** | *was 4.02.* Recipe D on the two identical 2nd-phase screens, Recipe F on the five dispatchers, Recipe C on the three runs the hand-over shares, then eight extractions and Recipe S for `entry_break_in.c` |
| `entry_break_in.c` | **10.00** | split from `entry.c`. Two Recipe X splits on the break-in dispatch and one Recipe E on `Break_Into_05`'s arms |
| `next_cpu.c` | **10.00** | *was 5.35.* Recipe V on `Setup_PL_Color`'s fifteen colour arms - the case the recipe was written for - then Recipe D on the three scene dispatchers, and Recipe S for `next_cpu_setup.c` |
| `next_cpu_setup.c` | **10.00** | split from `next_cpu.c`. One shared run and one arm |
| `sel_pl.c` | **10.00** | *was 5.73.* Two Recipe S splits first - the file was 1537 LoC - then Recipe V on the auto-repeat directions and nine extractions and named conditions |
| `sel_pl_exit.c` | **10.00** | split from `sel_pl.c`. Recipe D on the two handicap steps, then Recipe F on the two switches that name them in opposite order |
| `sel_pl_faces.c` | **10.00** | split from `sel_pl.c`. One arm of `Face_2nd` and one of `OBJ_1st`'s two layouts |
| `n_input.c`, `staff.c`, `ranking.c`, `gameover.c`, `win.c`, `continue.c` | **10.00** | the rest of the screen folder. `staff.c` wanted Recipe D on thirteen copies of one credit line and Recipe A on `set_credit_string`'s five arguments |
| `vs_shell.c`, `sel_data.c` | n/a | pure `const` data tables with no functions; CodeScene returns no score and the catalogue puts them out of scope |
| `end_00.c` | **10.00** | *was 7.68.* See *Retry a rejected extraction* - the same edit measured flat twice and then worth 1.19 |
| `end_02.c`, `end_03.c`, `end_06.c`, `end_11.c`, `end_13.c`, `end_main.c` | **10.00** | the rest of the ending folder that could be cleared |
| `end_14.c` | 8.03 | *was 6.85.* The hardest file in either folder. Four eight-label dispatchers need Recipe X, and the splits leave two near-twin pairs; `end_e00_0000_col_sub` and its twin differ by one statement in the innermost position, which needs a tri-state verdict neither Recipe C nor E allows. Three further shared runs were measured afterwards - the rise, the position commit and the placement - and all three are flat: they reshape the five groups without clearing one, so they were reverted |
| `end_04.c` | 9.09 | *was 8.28.* Seven shared runs. The redundant `break;` inside `end_402_1000`'s `if` - the arm breaks anyway - looked like a blocker, and the answer was Recipe C's 0/1 protocol rather than deleting it: the helper reports whether it fired and that one caller keeps its break at the call site. What is left is three pairs differing in effect ids and limits |
| `end_05.c` | 8.81 | *was 8.24.* Two near-miss pairs; one writes `Request_Fade(1) != 0` where the other writes `Request_Fade(3)` |
| `end_10.c`, `end_12.c`, `end_16.c`, `end_17.c`, `end_18.c`, `end_20.c` | 9.38 | all the same shape: one or two **two-instance** Recipe V families left. Recipe V asks for three, and relaxing that to two is exactly the near-miss merge Recipe D refuses |
| `end_01.c` | 9.60 | a measured refusal. `end_100_0000` is cc 14 with seven labels, so only a dedup plus a split gets under; that clears Complex Method and raises Overall Code Complexity in its place, and the nine-function mean will not come down. The whole sequence measured -0.22 and was reverted |
| `se.c` | **10.00** | *was 8.95.* One Recipe P. Naming `Stage_BGM`'s four-term arcade-Gill test cleared the Complex Conditional, and the `Se_Myself`/`Se_Myself_Die` duplication group went with it - in a file this small the added function moved the pair under the detector's threshold |
| `cps3sound.c` | **10.00** | *was 8.65.* `SsRequestCore`'s three request shapes agree on some forty channel writes, so the five shared runs came first and the Recipe E split of the arms last - *Share the run before splitting the shape*, on a file where splitting first would plainly have made a duplication pair. One Recipe P for the channel reject test in between |
| `sound3rd.c` | **10.00** | *was 6.59*, and the hardest file in the sound folder: `BGM_Server` at cc 57 with 9 bumps and depth 5. Three identical playback blocks (Recipe D) and four more shared runs and predicates took it to cc 21 before any arm was lifted; then six extractions and Recipe X on the kind dispatch. `sound_request_for_dc` and `remake_sound_code_for_DC` each split into a normalising shell plus the dispatch that was their whole complexity, and `latch_bgm_request`'s eleven labels - a floor of cc 12 that no extraction reaches - needed **two** Recipe X levels, each fallthrough kept inside the function holding both its ends |
| `se_data.c` | n/a | pure `const` data tables with no functions; CodeScene returns no score and the catalogue puts them out of scope |
| `lose_pl.c` | **10.00** | *was 7.58.* One Recipe D for the scroll-correction block, two Recipe P, then the chain that does the work: six Recipe E extractions turning every `case 0:` body into a named start, which leaves four switches differing in one callee and one Recipe F collapses them |
| `win_pl.c` | **10.00** | *was 3.56*, and the file that taught the folder its lesson - see *Extraction stops where the next cut would create a twin* below. Twenty copies of one block, thirteen of one predicate, then Recipe E/F on six shared winners, three Recipe S splits, and a last Recipe D pair for the two pose-select idioms |
| `win_pl_q.c` | 9.02 | *split out of `win_pl.c`.* `q_em_distance_chk` keeps two bumps: its arms differ only in the operand order of one subtraction, which Recipe D does not reach and no operator may be flipped to make them fit. Naming the shared threshold test measured flat and left the finding, so it was reverted |
| `win_pl_gill.c`, `win_pl_urien.c` | **10.00** | *split out of `win_pl.c`.* Gill's arrived clean; Urien's needed one Recipe X, seven case labels being a floor of cc 8 that the three extractions already made could not reach |
| `appear.c`, `appear_late.c` | **10.00** and 9.38 | *was 3.56 for the one file.* Forty-three copies of two handover idioms went first (Recipe D, 3.56 -> 4.33), then the split at Appear_20000 - which needed the campaign-helper exception above - and then Recipe E, X and R on both halves. Both plateau on **Overall Code Complexity alone** - a mean of 4.19 and 4.63 against a threshold of 4, across fifty-three and thirty-eight functions. The plateau was tested, not assumed: a batch of four more Recipe X splits aimed squarely at that mean measured **9.38 -> 8.28**, because four helpers of the same shape become a duplication group among themselves. The mean cannot be walked down by splitting **into helpers of one shape**, which is what that batch was, and the `end_*.c` files sit at the same number. It can be walked down by extractions that differ from each other: `appear.c` is at **10.00**, and `mean_probe.py` prices `appear_late.c` at **eight** more low-complexity functions for 10.00 - see the amendment under *Count the functions before you extract* |
| `app_data.c` | n/a | pure `const` data tables, like `se_data.c` |
| `pause.c`, `reset.c` | **10.00** | *were 8.07 and 9.31.* `pause.c` took one Recipe D - its two menu setups differ by a single `r_no[2]` value - plus a Recipe P, two Recipe E and a Recipe X; `reset.c` took one Recipe P and one Recipe E |
| `sys_sub.c` | 8.66 | *was 4.83.* Eleven Complex Methods and both Complex Conditionals cleared, then three Recipe S splits. Two functions are **measured refusals, not plateaus**: `Meltw`, whose decompression loop writes six outer locals across any boundary Recipe E could draw, and `Convert_User_Setting`, for the reason in *A varying subscript is not a varying literal* below |
| `sys_sub_em.c`, `sys_sub_replay.c` | 9.38, 9.31 | *split out of `sys_sub.c`* |
| `sys_sub_ranking.c` | 8.54 | *split out of `sys_sub.c`.* The four `Check_Sort_*` inserts differ in **a callee and a base offset**. Recipe F allows the callee but nothing else varying, and the offsets sit inside three subscripts where the base-0 instance writes `Ranking_Data[j]` rather than `Ranking_Data[j + 0]` - so no helper is a verbatim move. Recipes D, F, T and N each refuse it for their own reason |
| `sysdir.c` | 8.80 | *unchanged, and the whole attempt reverted.* `get_system_direction_parameter` is 146 lines of forty independent flag assignments across ten menu pages. Ten per-page helpers clear Complex Method and Large Method but three of them twin: **8.80 -> 8.54**. Five merged helpers break the twins and land back over the complexity threshold: **8.80 -> 8.48**. There is no cut that is neither |
| `saver.c`, `sys_sub2.c` | **10.00** | already clean at baseline |
| `work_sys.c` | n/a | CodeScene returns no score |
| `count.c`, `flash_lp.c`, `input_history.c` | **10.00** | *were 8.24, 8.95 and 9.02.* Ordinary Recipe P/C/D/E work; `flash_lp.c` went 8.95 -> 10.00 on two extractions from one cc-14 function |
| `sc_sub.c` | 9.31 | *was 4.06, then 8.47.* Four Recipe S splits first, then **Recipe A across fifteen functions** and roughly 141 call sites, which took Excess Number of Function Arguments off the file. `scfont_sqput2` is what remains and is a measured refusal: its two arms are the same doubly-nested loop differing in **one** sub-expression, so lifting either leaves a helper that pairs with the arm still inline - 9.31 -> 9.09. See *The one-arm rule needs the arms to differ by more than one expression* |
| `sc_sub_logo.c` | 9.02 | *split out of `sc_sub.c`.* `hnc_wipeout` went 7.87 -> 9.02 on a single Recipe D of a four-line UV loop, because both copies sat three levels deep - deduplication paid there as nesting relief, not as line count |
| `sc_sub_transition.c`, `sc_sub_combo.c`, `sc_sub_training.c` | 9.31, 9.38, 9.42 | *split out of `sc_sub.c`.* The transition file's `ToneDown`/`overwrite_panel`/`Akaobi` trio is a measured refusal: structurally identical but differing in a table, a colour and a priority - three values - *and* in their local variable names, so no recipe reaches it and no contiguous run exists to extract. `WipeIn`'s two bumps **move rather than go**: lifting the whole drawing block measures flat because both nests travel into the helper intact, and lifting the row arm alone measures 9.02 |
| `MemMan.c` | 9.92 | *was 9.24.* One change: the `else` that followed a `break` in both gap walks. It cleared Deep, Nested Complexity outright and one of two Bumpy Roads, added no function, and the guard read OK at 9 literals. `mmAllocSub` keeps two bumps - lifting its backward walk clears them and measures 9.38 on the twin it makes with `mm_find_gap_forward` |
| `PPGFile.c` | 9.38 | *was 9.31.* Recipe E on the palette handle scan. `ppgCheckTextureDataBe` is its mirror and keeps its loop inline; the two could not share a helper in any case, since one walks a `Palette` and the other a `Texture` |
| `plapx.c` | 9.48 | `set_apx_pixel_format` is 92 lines against a threshold of 70 and an obvious Recipe X, and **every** split is refused for one reason: `set_apx_clut_format` is the same table minus the pitch line, so whichever arms leave, the shortened parent pairs with it. Cutting 24 and 32 behind a `default` measures 9.38 |
| `emlTSB.c` | 9.50 | `mlTsbRequest` is cc 18 - one base, one `while`, fourteen case labels, two for the `&&`. Reaching 8 means removing ten branches; extracting every action arm removes six. The remainder is seven enumerated no-op labels, and deleting those is refused by *A Recipe X split must still name every enumerator*. Priced by arithmetic, not attempted |
| `appear_late.c` | 9.38 | Overall Code Complexity alone over 38 functions. Probing with one, two, three, four and six throwaway functions measures 9.38 every time, which read as "wider than any honest extraction closes" - **but the search had stopped early.** `tools/mean_probe.py` binary-searches it to **eight**, and at eight the file is at 10.00 with nothing else in it. `demo00.c` is the same number. The constraint that remains is the one in the row above: the eight have to differ from one another, because four helpers of one shape measured 9.38 -> 8.28 |
| the 9.38 two-member tier | 9.38 | Ten files - `renderer.c`, `sdl_pad.c`, `eff93.c`, `end_20.c`, `plcnt_setup.c`, `opening_bg1.c`, `opening_scenes.c`, `ramcnt.c`, `sc_sub_gauges.c`, `sc_sub_logo.c` - each holding one or two mirrored pairs differing in literals, an operator or a type. Extracting the shared run was measured on the two best candidates and moved nothing; in seven of the ten the longest balanced shared run is 0 to 3 lines. See *Extracting a shared run does not break a skeleton pair* |

### The table-scan idiom, and how `grade.c` was unblocked

`grade.c` was the first plateau in this campaign that was **not** duplication between
sibling state machines. Its six big functions are built almost entirely out of one idiom, repeated
about twenty times:

```c
for (i = 0; i < 23; i++) {
    if (num < grade_t_meichuuritsu2[i + 1][0]) {
        break;
    }
}

point2 = grade_t_meichuuritsu2[i][1];
```

Find the first row of a threshold table the value falls under, then take that row's score.
Each occurrence differs in **three** things: the table, its row count, and the value being
compared. Recipe D allows one differing value, and the prohibition on parameterising more
than one is the point of that rule, so the idiom cannot be shared. Recipe C does not reach
it either - the runs are not identical. Recipe E does not apply, because the loops are not
nested: they sit at depth 1, one after another.

That left `get_offence_total`, `get_defence_total`, `get_ex_point_total`,
`makeup_final_grade`, `grade_makeup_stage_parameter` and `get_tech_pts_total` all flagged,
with splitting any of them leaving both halves over the threshold, for the arithmetic
reason recorded above.

**This is now Recipe T.** The project owner authorised the narrow extension the paragraph
above asked for: a helper may take a *table, its length, and the value to look up* when the
extracted body is character-for-character identical across every call site and each call
site passes its own table verbatim. It is mechanically checkable, and it is strictly
narrower than Recipe A. See *Recipe T - Shared Table Scan* above for the preconditions.

Applied, it took `grade.c` from **8.67 to 10.00** in eleven commits, one per function: the
Complex Method went with the first, and each remaining Bumpy Road cleared as its own
function's scans collapsed. The one finding Recipe T did not reach, `makeup_spp_frdat`,
was three unrelated loops and wanted an ordinary Recipe E.

## The verification loop

After **every** commit:

```bash
cmake --build build
```

`cmake` is not on PATH by default on the Windows dev machine. Prepend the toolchain:

```bash
export PATH="/c/msys64/mingw64/bin:$PATH"
```

A single-file change rebuilds and links in roughly 30 seconds.

Then check that no constant moved:

```bash
python tools/refactor_guard.py <file>
```

This extracts every numeric, string, and character literal from the file before and after
your change and compares the counts:

- **FAIL** - a value vanished from the file, or a count dropped while another rose. That
  is a substituted constant (`30` became `31`) or deleted logic. Revert.
- **WARN** - counts only dropped and every value is still present. That is what
  deduplication looks like. Recipes **D** and **P** both produce it legitimately: pulling
  a repeated condition into one named predicate removes copies of its literals without
  changing any of them.
- **WARN** - counts only rose. A new guard clause brings its own `return 0`.
- **WARN** - counts dropped and only `0`/`1` rose. That is extract-to-predicate: a
  duplicated block became a named boolean helper, so the call sites lost the block's
  literals and the helper brought its own returns. Confirm the helper *is* the block
  rather than a rewrite of it. (Recognised since 2026-09-15, on the project owner's
  directive - before that the guard scored this legal Recipe D shape as a substitution
  and blocked it.)
- **OK** - nothing changed.

A `WARN` is not a pass mark, it is a request for a second look. The tool cannot tell
deduplication apart from *deleting* one copy of a duplicated block, so a human confirms
those before they land. `--strict` turns warnings into failures.

Then check that no call went missing:

```bash
python tools/refactor_guard.py --calls <file>
```

This compares the multiset of **called function names** before and after, so a call
dropped or duplicated inside a rewritten branch shows up even when every literal still
matches. It is the check that makes Recipes C and X cheap to trust; run it whenever you
extract or split.

Two shapes are expected, both measured against real campaign commits:

| Recipe | Signature |
| --- | --- |
| E, G, X (extract, flatten, split) | **nothing removed**; each new helper `+2` - its definition and the one call that replaced the block |
| C, D (deduplicate) | the shared callees drop by the number of copies removed; the helper is `+1` per call site and `+1` for its definition |

A name that disappears from the file entirely is a **FAIL**: something was deleted, not
moved. Anything else that does not match the two rows above wants explaining before it
lands.

**After a Recipe S split, check the group rather than each file.** A split moves whole
functions, so each file on its own reads as calls vanishing or appearing; only the union
is meant to be unchanged:

```bash
python tools/refactor_guard.py --calls --combined <old-file> <new-file>
```

`OK combined group (N call sites unchanged)` is the result a clean split gives, and it is
strong evidence: it says every call in the original is still made, from one of the two
files, the same number of times.

**`--combined` is needed for the literal check too, and `--all` cannot do it.** The same
logic applies to constants: the functions that left took their literals with them, so the
original file on its own reports them as *gone from the file entirely* and the guard says
**FAIL**. That is not a defect and it must not be reverted - it is what a split looks like
from one side of the cut.

```bash
python tools/refactor_guard.py --combined <old-file> <new-file> [<new-file> ...]
```

Watch for this after a split, because `--all` checks every changed file **individually**
and will print `BLOCKED - this is not a legal campaign refactor` over a split that is
perfectly sound. Verified on `mtrans.c`, `mtrans_seqs.c` and `mtrans_pool.c`: `--all`
FAILs on `mtrans.c`, the three-file `--combined` run passes on both checks. Run the
combined form over the whole split group and trust that; if you reach for `--all` on a
branch that contains a split, read its output knowing it cannot see the group.

**Renaming a helper you extracted earlier reads as a vanished call**, because the tool
sees only that the old name is gone. Renaming a `static` that no other file can see is
legal - the prohibition is on renaming functions across files - so declare it and run
again:

```bash
python tools/refactor_guard.py --calls --renamed old_name=new_name <file>
```

The declaration rewrites the old name in the *before* fingerprint and nothing else, so
the counts still have to balance: a call genuinely dropped in the same commit still
FAILs. Do not reach for it to silence a name you did not rename.

It does not see *reordering*. Nothing mechanical in this repo does, which is why the
prohibition on reordering side effects is absolute rather than advisory.

Then re-measure with the CodeScene MCP server:

```
code_health_score(file_path="<absolute path to the file>")
```

| Result | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Build fails | Fix it, or revert. Never commit a broken build. |
| Guard FAILs | `git checkout -- <file>`. No exceptions. |
| Score up | Keep it. Commit. Next function. |
| Score flat or down | **Do not revert yet.** Check the review first - see below. |

### A flat score does not mean a failed refactor

The file score is a single aggregate over every function in the file. In a 5,000-line
module with 111 functions, fixing one function can move it by less than the score's
resolution. Reverting on a flat score would throw away good work.

So when the score does not move, run the detailed review and ask a sharper question:
**did the smell I targeted actually go away?**

```
code_health_review(file_path="<absolute path>")
```

- The function **left** a category it was in (Deep Nested Complexity, Bumpy Road, Large
  Method), or its cyclomatic complexity dropped: **keep the change and commit.**
- The function is still listed with the same numbers: **revert.** The transformation did
  not do what you intended.

A real example from this campaign. Extracting one nested switch out of `Menu_Select` left
the file score at 2.25, unchanged. The review showed the function had dropped out of three
categories and its complexity had fallen from 19 to 12. Keeping it was correct.

Score is the campaign-level signal. Per-step, the review is the signal.

### When the score falls but the review improves

Sometimes a correct transformation *lowers* the score. This is real, it is measurable, and
it happened three times in the September 2026 sessions.

The cause is always the same: decomposing one state machine makes it look like its
sibling, and the duplication detector prices that resemblance above the complexity you
removed. Splitting `ORO_JA_Term`'s airborne half cost 0.25, and a larger version of the
same split cost 0.87. Fixing `Command_Attack`'s complexity cost 0.57 - until the parameter
structs made its two siblings stop reading alike, after which the identical change was
free and took the file to 10.00.

**Duplication-by-shape between sibling state machines is an artifact of decomposition, not
a defect introduced by it.** So:

- Record both numbers in the commit message, and say which smell went.
- Prefer the variant with the better *review*, not the better score, and say so.
- Where the cost is large and the smell is small - one point of cyclomatic complexity
  against 0.87 of score - keep the higher score and record the file as plateaued.
- Never "fix" sibling similarity by merging two state machines that differ only in their
  state numbering. That needs a literal change and is forbidden.

### Share the run before splitting the shape

The eff09 rule below says to extract the shared runs before judging whether a file's
duplication is a plateau. `bg_textures.c` showed the same rule governs the *order* of two
steps that each measure flat on their own.

`Bg_Kakikae_Set` had three arms, two of them long. Splitting those two arms into their own
functions - ordinary Recipe X, the obvious move for a mean-complexity finding - measured
**9.38 -> 8.81**. Each arm carried its own copy of a six-line block that loads a rewrite
slot out of `bgrw_data_tbl`, and once the arms were functions rather than `case` bodies,
the duplication detector priced them as a pair.

Sharing that block first (Recipe D, one differing value - the slot) measured **flat**.
The arms were still inside the switch, so no function-level complexity moved.

Applied in that order, the pair measures **9.38 -> 10.00**.

Neither commit pays alone and each is legal on its own, so rule 2's "keep it if the review
improved" is not enough to find this: the first commit's review is unchanged. **When a
split is going to expose a pair, look for what the two halves would then share, and take
that first.** The reverse ordering is not merely worth less, it is worth *negative* - the
file ends below where it started.

---

### The eff09 family: separate the shape from the substance

`eff09.c` and its three split files all sat at 8.54-8.81 on Code Duplication, and the
first reading was that the whole family was immovable. That was wrong, and the way it was
wrong is the lesson.

Their duplication is two different things wearing the same label:

- **Substance - identical runs that really are shared.** A frame gate repeated seven
  times, a four-line show-and-init entry repeated three times, a speed-table load, a
  placement block. All of it is ordinary Recipe C and P work and all of it pays.
- **Shape - dispatchers that differ only in which functions they call.** `eff09_4000`
  against `eff09_27000`, `eff09_17000` against `eff09_18000`: same switch, same labels,
  different callees. Merging them means passing function pointers, which is not a recipe
  in this catalogue.

Clearing the substance moved three of the four files:

| File | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `eff09_animation.c` | 8.81 | **10.00** |
| `eff09_endgame.c` | 8.81 | 9.38 |
| `eff09_late.c` | 8.81 | 9.38 |
| `eff09.c` | 8.54 | 8.54 |

`eff09.c` is the one that does not move. The same extractions were applied to it twice -
the gate, the entry, the ball style, and the 18 copies of the draw pair, 36 lines into 18
- and the score did not shift, because the file is 1,200 lines carrying **five
independent near-miss pairs**, and removing shared runs from around them leaves every
pair standing. Two of those pairs are `adjust_sean_ball_left`/`_right`, which differ in
five values and contain an arcade-accurate bug that must stay.

**The rule to take away:** when a file reports Code Duplication, separate the shared runs
from the shared shape before calling it a plateau. Extract the runs, measure, and only
then judge. A file can look identical to its neighbour in the review and still have most
of a point in it.

### Between two twin arms, extract from one of them only

When a function's two arms are structural twins that Recipe D may not merge - they differ
in a comparison operator, an offset, or a constant - extracting the *same* helper from both
creates a new twin pair, and the duplication the metric then sees costs more than the
complexity removed. Extracting from **one arm only** keeps the win and creates no twin.

Measured on `pls03_super_arts.c`'s `try_grounded_ex_super` / `try_airborne_ex_super`, whose
gate chains differ only in a DIP constant and `>` against `<`:

| What was done | Score |
| --- | --- |
| baseline | 5.32 |
| gate chain extracted from **both** arms | 5.29 |
| gate chain extracted from the **grounded arm only** | **5.46** |

**Unless extracting both brings the parent under the threshold.** That is the deciding
question, and it is worth checking before settling for one arm. Measured on the same
file's `check_super_arts_attack_dc`, cc 29 with a strength loop in each arm:

| What was done | Score |
| --- | --- |
| baseline | 5.67 |
| loop extracted from the **grounded arm only** | 5.71 |
| loop extracted from **both** arms | **5.87** |

Here both wins, because with both loops gone the parent drops from cc 29 to under 9 and
loses its Complex Method *and* Large Method findings - more than the new twin pair costs.
In the gate-chain case above, extracting both left the parent flagged anyway, so the twin
penalty was all that changed.

So the rule is not "always one arm". It is: **extract both only if that clears the
parent's findings; otherwise extract one.** Same arithmetic as *Do not extract an arm that
is still too big*, applied to the parent rather than the piece.

**And weigh each arm against the twin family it would join, not just its own twin.** The
cost of a new near-twin grows with how many near-twins the file already has, so an arm that
would be the third or fourth member of a family is dearer than one that would be the
second - even when the parent clears either way.

Measured on `plmain.c`'s `sag_union_1`, cc 17 with two liftable states:

| What was done | Score |
| --- | --- |
| baseline | 6.94 |
| states 2 and 4 both lifted | 6.69 |
| state 4 only | **7.09** |

The parent cleared its finding in both of the last two. The difference is that state 2's
helper would have been the *third* `spend_or_abandon`-shaped function in the file, while
state 4's has no close relative. So: before lifting an arm, look at what is already in the
file, not only at what the arm is paired with.

Where one arm is the answer, the asymmetry reads slightly odd, so say in the commit message
that the other arm was left inline deliberately and why.

This is the same force behind *Two mirrored arms are cheaper left together* below; the
difference is that here one arm can still be improved for free.

### Grouping case labels duplicates them, and the guard will say so

A switch whose arms share an opening guard looks like a Recipe C candidate: group the
labels into one arm, write the guard once, and move what differs into a helper that
switches on the same expression again. It is behaviour-preserving, and it is not legal.

Each label ends up written **twice** - once in the grouped arm and once in the helper - and
`refactor_guard.py` reports it as a substituted constant:

```
FAIL  a constant was substituted
      removed x8  num 0
      added   x1  num 14 ... 30   (all nine labels)
```

The rule that catches this is the same one that forbids renumbering states, and the hazard
is real rather than bureaucratic: a dispatch written in two places will eventually be
changed in one of them. `pls03.c`'s `check_nm_attack` was refactored this way, measured
-0.04, tripped the guard, and was reverted.

**A FAIL is a stop, including when the replay is clean and the reasoning looks sound.** The
replay agreed with that change; it was still wrong.

### Retry a rejected extraction once the file has improved

A measurement is only valid for the file as it stood. The cost of a new
near-twin is weighed against everything else the file is already carrying, so an
extraction that measured negative early can measure strongly positive later,
with no change to the extraction itself.

Measured on `plpdm.c`'s `set_dm_hos_flag_sky`. Naming its two distance checks -
which cannot be merged, since both limits differ - was tried twice, the same
edit both times:

| When | File score before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| with five other findings still open | 7.15 | 6.99 |
| after those were cleared | 8.66 | **9.53** |

The second time it was worth +0.87. Nothing about the edit changed; what changed
is that it had become the file's last real finding, so clearing it was worth far
more than the twin pair costs.

So: keep a note of what you rejected and why, and come back to it when the file
is close to done. The rejections worth revisiting are the ones refused for
duplication cost rather than for a rule.

`end_00.c` is the sharpest version of this, because the same edit was measured three
times without changing a character of it:

| When | Score |
| --- | --- |
| with Complex Method still open on three functions | 7.86, flat |
| with one of the two duplication pairs still open | 8.81, flat |
| with that pair cleared first | 8.81 -> **10.00** |

The edit was a four-copy Recipe C on the scene opening, and both times it was reverted
under rule 2 because it cleared no finding. What changed on the third attempt is that
`end_000_0000` and `end_000_0003` had become the file's **last** duplication group, so
dissolving it was worth the whole of the remaining finding instead of a share of it.

**So the order to work a duplication-heavy file is: clear the other findings first, then
take the shared runs.** Taking the runs early is not wrong, but it measures flat, and
rule 2 will make you revert work you will only have to redo.

### Clear the functions just over the threshold first

A finding is worth score only while it exists. Taking a function from cc 25 to cc 20 keeps
the Complex Method finding and pays almost nothing; taking one from cc 10 to cc 6 removes
the finding outright and pays properly. So work the list from the **bottom** - the
functions barely over the threshold - not the top.

Measured on `pls03.c` in one run, all of them one small Recipe E or P each:

| Function | cc before -> after | Score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `check_leap_attack` | 10 -> 6 | +0.14 |
| `check_chouhatsu` | 10 -> 8 | +0.15 |
| `ex_slot_is_allowed` | 11 -> 5 | +0.17 |
| `meoshi_cancel_gate` | 10 -> 6 | +0.16 |

Together **+0.62**, from four extractions of a dozen lines each. The same file's
`check_special_attack_airborne`, a much larger piece of work on a cc 23 function, was worth
+0.13 on its own.

This does not mean never touch the big ones - a big function that can be brought *under*
the threshold is worth more than any of these. It means: when a big one cannot be brought
under, spend the time on the small ones instead.

### For a Complex Conditional, name the whole condition, not its parts

CodeScene counts the logical operators in the expression **at the branch**. Replacing the
operands with named predicates leaves the operator count unchanged, so the finding stays.

Measured on `pls03.c`'s `decode_wst_data`. Its 0xA000 arm tested three things at once:

```c
if ((wk->wu.mvxy.a[1].sp > 0) && (lever == (wk->cp->sw_new & 0xF)) &&
    cmd_ex_check(wk->wu.xyz[1].disp.pos, cmd_ex)) {
```

Naming the lever test and the height test separately measured **flat** and left both
findings in place - the arm still joined three terms with `&&`. Replacing the whole
condition with one predicate, `rising_with_lever_at_height(wk, lever, cmd_ex)`, cleared
both findings and was worth **+0.06**.

So: one name for the whole `if`, even when the parts have good names of their own.

**But the opposite is true for Complex Method.** That finding counts every `&&` and `||`
in the function wherever they sit, so moving terms into named helpers is exactly what
reduces it. `grade.c`'s `guard_was_not_deliberate` was five lines at cc 9 - a seven-term
conjunction and nothing else - and splitting it into three named halves took it to cc 3 and
cleared the finding, worth +0.13.

So check which finding you are looking at before choosing:

| Finding | What helps |
| --- | --- |
| Complex Conditional | one name for the **whole** condition at the branch |
| Complex Method driven by a long boolean | names for the **parts**, moving the operators out |

### Recipe X pays only if both halves come in under the threshold

The same arithmetic as *Do not extract an arm that is still too big*, applied to a split
dispatch. Splitting a switch in two leaves each half with roughly half the arms - and a
switch's cyclomatic complexity is driven by its arm count, so a switch far above the
threshold does not get both halves below it.

Measured on `decode_wst_data`, a twelve-arm switch at cc 29. Splitting it six and six
measured **-0.03** (5.35 -> 5.32): the two halves came out at about cc 15 and cc 14, so the
file gained a second Complex Method instead of losing one, and the two halves then read as
near-twins into the bargain. Reverted.

Before splitting a dispatch, divide: if arms/2 is still over 9, the split will not pay.
`decode_wst_data` is recorded as a plateau for this reason - its complexity is its twelve
command encodings, and the only way to reduce the arm count is to renumber or merge
encodings, which is a literal change.

### Do not extract an arm that is still too big

Recipe E on a `switch` arm pays only if the piece you lift out comes in **under the
thresholds** - cyclomatic complexity 9 and 70 lines. If it does not, the file trades one
flagged function for two and the score falls.

Measured on `plmain.c`'s `sag_union_ps2`. Lifting out case 2's whole `gt2` dispatch was
worth **+0.30** (4.38 -> 4.68): the piece landed at cc 16 and the parent dropped from
cc 44. Going one level further and lifting the `gt2 == 1` arm out of *that* cost
**-0.14** (4.68 -> 4.54): the new helper was 74 lines at cc 22, so the file gained a
second Complex Method *and* a second Large Method while the parent only fell to cc 16.
Reverted.

Check the arm's own size before extracting it. When an arm is too big to help as a
function but too complex to leave, name a **pure predicate inside it** instead - that
lowers the parent's complexity without creating a second flagged function.
`vital_drain_is_paused` in `check_omop_vital` is the worked example, +0.05 where an arm
extraction would have cost.

### Never apply the same split across an already-duplicated family

The rule above is about two arms inside one function. This one is about several
functions, and it costs more.

When CodeScene already reports a group of functions as duplicates of each other, applying
the *same* extraction to each of them multiplies the duplication instead of reducing it.
Three near-identical functions split the same way become six near-identical halves, and
the detector prices the larger group.

Measured in `pls03.c`: `check_full_gauge_attack`, `check_full_gauge_attack2` and
`check_super_arts_attack_dc` were one duplication group of three. Splitting each on its
grounded/airborne seam - the identical split that had just paid on `check_special_attack`,
which was *not* in a duplication group - took the file 2.26 -> 2.12 and was reverted.

**So check the duplication groups in the review before extracting.** A split that pays on
a lone function will usually cost on a member of a duplicate family. Fix the family first,
if a legal recipe can, or leave it alone.

### Two mirrored arms are cheaper left together

The commonest remaining smell in this codebase is a Bumpy Road whose two bumps are the
arms of one `if (rl_flag)` - the same statements written once for each facing, differing
in a sign, an offset or a comparison. Extracting each arm into its own helper clears the
Bumpy Road and is perfectly legal. It also **costs between 0.2 and 0.6**, every time,
because the two helpers are then near-identical functions and the duplication detector
prices that above the nesting removed.

Measured this way: `effd1.c` 9.92 -> 9.38, `effe9.c` 9.92 -> 9.38, `effl7.c` 9.61 -> 9.09,
`effect.c` 9.38 -> 9.16.

So: leave a mirrored pair inline and record the file as plateaued. The move is still worth
trying once on a file where the two arms are *not* mirrors - where they do genuinely
different work - and there it usually pays.

### Overall Code Complexity is a whole-file average

`Overall Code Complexity` is the mean cyclomatic complexity over every function in the
file, so it moves when you add a function, not only when you change one. A single
extraction can clear `Complex Method` on the function you targeted and trip
`Overall Code Complexity` for the file, leaving the score lower than before - `effl7.c`
measured 9.61, then 9.31 after one extraction, then 10.00 after three.

When a file shows `Overall Code Complexity`, measure the *set* of extractions together
rather than reverting the first one that looks like a loss. Say so in the commit message
when that is why several extractions share a commit.

---

### What the guard does not cover

The guard checks constants, not control flow. An inverted condition with no literal change
passes it cleanly - so it reduces risk, it does not remove it. That is why Track B stays
closed until statcheck runs.

Use `code_health_review` (not just the score) when you need to see *which* smells remain -
the score alone will not tell you whether you hit the right problem.

---

### Recipe S first, then the duplication it exposes

`charset_commands.c` was the clearest case measured so far. At 132 functions it carried a
*Number of Functions in a Single Module* finding that no extraction could touch, and a Code
Duplication web of 34 functions in 19 groups spanning the whole file.

Moving the 21 position-and-speed opcodes into `charset_position.c` (Recipe S) took the
original from 7.00 to 7.96 and gave the new file 7.27. That is the smaller half of the win.
The larger half is what the split made possible: with each duplication family now whole
inside one file, five ordinary Recipe C and Recipe D merges took `charset_commands.c` to
10.00 and `charset_position.c` to 9.09.

The rule that made the split work is the one already written down for Recipe S - **move a
duplication family whole** - and the way to check it is to run the review first and list
which functions share a group. A split that cuts through a group leaves both halves with a
finding neither file can clear on its own.

### A duplicated call site is worth extracting even when the score does not move

`plmain.c` had eight places that cleared the same three fields in the same order. CodeScene
reported none of them: three lines is below its duplication threshold. Extracting them into
`abandon_super_art` moved the score from 8.03 to 9.09 anyway, because the *near-miss*
groups it did report - three `spend_or_abandon_*` functions that differed in two or three
statements each - stopped reading as near-misses once their shared tail was a call.

So when the review reports a duplication group that Recipe D refuses (too many
differences), look for a shorter identical run **inside** the group and extract that
instead. It is Recipe C, it is always legal, and it can dissolve a group that could not be
merged.

### An arm that ends in `break` inside a `while (1)` is not a plateau

`pls02.c`'s `set_field_hosei_flag` and `plcnt.c`'s `settle_check` both used the
`while (1) { ... break; ... }` idiom to mean "retry" or "fall out to the tail". Two
different attempts to remove it were measured:

- `settle_check`: extracting the arm's body into `settle_double_ko` and leaving the loop
  alone, +0.55.
- `set_field_hosei_flag`: rewriting the loop as two functions and a flag, -0.70 at 8.65 and
  -0.77 again at 9.31 after the file had improved.

The difference is the twin. `settle_double_ko` has no sibling; the two wall sides of
`set_field_hosei_flag` differ in three places and become a duplication group the moment
they are separate functions.

**Then the twin was broken, and the same rewrite took the file to 10.00.** `pls02.c` held
a *latent* pair - `setup_move_data_easy` and `read_adrs_store_mvxy`, not flagged on their
own but counted against anything new - and once Recipe C had taken the four lines they
share, the ledger changed completely:

| Move | Before the latent twin was broken | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| split the two wall sides | 9.31 -> 9.02 | 9.31 -> **9.92** |
| then remove the `while (1)` | -0.70, twice | 9.92 -> **10.00** |

So the rule is not "keep the loop". It is: **a `while (1)` whose every path returns or
breaks is not a loop, and removing it is free - but only once the file can afford the
functions that removing it creates.** Count the latent pairs first; if the body you are
about to lift has a sibling, take that sibling's shared run before you lift anything.

---

### Break the twin first, then split the survivor

`cmd_main_checks.c` held two dash commands, `check_10` and `check_12`, that
CodeScene reported as a duplication pair and that were both Complex Methods at
cc 18 and 19. Splitting either one alone had been the obvious move; splitting
both was the obvious trap. What actually worked was a sequence:

1. **Recipe X on one of them.** States 2 and up of `check_10` moved behind
   `default:` into a helper. +0.28, and `check_10` left the duplication group -
   it no longer looks like its twin.
2. **Then read the twin again.** With `check_10` reshaped, `check_12`'s states
   2, 3 and 4 turned out to be byte-for-byte identical to the helper that had
   just been extracted. It became a **Recipe D** call to the same helper, not a
   second split. +0.36, fifty duplicated lines gone, and `check_12` left the
   group too.

The lesson generalises: when two functions are reported as a duplication pair
and both are too complex, do not split them symmetrically. Split one, then
re-read the other against the helper that came out. Often the second function
can *call* the first's helper, which is a merge rather than a second split -
and a merge never creates a new twin.

### The guard's literal fingerprint blocks array-typed parameters

Recipe D on a family of table scans wants a parameter of array type:

```c
static s16 sa_stock_points(s16 ix, const s16 table[][2]);
```

That `2` is a literal new to the file. Against the literals the merge removes -
four `0`s, four `1`s and two `5`s from the three loops it collapses -
`refactor_guard.py` reads the combination as *a constant was substituted* and
**FAILs**. The refactor is legal; the fingerprint cannot tell it from a
substitution.

The fix is to name the row type in a header:

```c
/* grade.h */
typedef const s16 GradeRow[2];
```

and write the parameter as `const GradeRow* table`. The `.c` file then gains no
literal at all and the guard reads the expected deduplication signature; the
header's own run is the legal "literals added, none removed". This is not a way
around the guard - the transformation is the same one either way - it is a way
to write the type where types belong so the fingerprint stays readable. It is a
precondition of **Recipe T**, not an optional tidying.

### The table-scan idiom, measured

`grade.c` is built from this shape, seventeen times:

```c
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        if (VALUE < TABLE[i + 1][0]) {
            break;
        }
    }

    point += TABLE[i][1];
```

Three things differ between instances: the table, its length, and the value
scanned. That is more than one, so **Recipe D does not apply**; the
`grade_table_points(table, count, value)` helper the code obviously wants is
**Recipe T**, added to the catalogue afterwards. The rules below are what was
legal before Recipe T existed, and they still hold for a family Recipe T's
preconditions refuse:

- **Group the scans by what they score**, not one function per scan. Nine scans
  in one helper is fine; three helpers of three scans each read as duplicates of
  one another and cost 0.09.
- **Recipe D still applies where only the table differs.** The super-art score
  scanned the same length with the same value from three tables; that is one
  difference and it merged.
- **Extract the non-scan work.** The ratio calculations in `get_offence_total`
  and `get_defence_total`, and the all-clear bonus in `makeup_final_grade`, are
  ordinary Recipe E extractions and were worth 0.20, 0.15 and 0.11.

### Recipe F pays only once the arms are already one statement

`pls03.c`'s `check_nm_attack` is the case that shows the ordering. Its nine stance arms
each read:

```c
case 20:
    if (is_blocked_by_hikusugi(wk)) {
        return 0;
    }

    select_nm_attack_level_3010(wk, kos, 3);
    break;
```

Applying Recipe F straight to that buys **nothing**: the arm keeps its `if`, so each arm
still costs two decisions and the cyclomatic complexity does not move. The guard cannot be
hoisted out of the switch either - `default:` does not have it.

What worked was three commits in this order, +0.48 between them:

1. **Recipe E first.** The whole switch answers one question, so it becomes
   `begin_nm_attack(wk, kos)` returning 0/1 and the caller keeps its early return and its
   tail. That clears Large Method, and - the point - it makes the arms' `return 0` and
   their fall-through into two values of one return.
2. **Then Recipe F.** Now each arm collapses to
   `return start_nm_attack(wk, kos, 3, select_nm_attack_level_3010);` - one decision, the
   `case` itself. cc 21 -> 12.
3. **Then Recipe X.** Twelve is still over the threshold, but nine one-line arms split
   cleanly: the three jumping stances and the standing fallback move behind `default:`,
   labels unchanged, and both halves come in under it. cc 12 -> cleared.

The general rule: **Recipe F removes the duplicated skeleton, not the branching inside
it.** If an arm still contains a conditional after the shared call is factored out, find
the recipe that turns that conditional into a return value first - usually Recipe E on the
whole dispatch - and apply Recipe F to what is left.

### What a Recipe F commit looks like to the guard

Measured on `charset_position.c` and `pls03.c`:

| Check | Reads |
| --- | --- |
| literal | the deduplication WARN - the duplicate `case` labels and guard returns are gone, every other value still present |
| `--calls` | the shared callee drops by the copies removed; the new helper is `+1` per call site and `+1` for its definition |
| `--calls` noise | `+1 void` and `+N` for the *parameter's* own name - a declarator and a pointer call both scan as calls. Expected, and it appears on every Recipe F |

Without `--fnptr`, each callee now passed by pointer reads as **a call vanished** and the
guard FAILs a legal refactor. Declaring it is not a way around the check: the counts still
have to balance, and a callee that really did vanish would show up as an unexplained
removal.

### A split on a duplicate-family member can still pay, if it clears two smells

*Never apply the same split across an already-duplicated family* stands, but it is a rule
about cost, not a prohibition, and `pls00_normal_states.c` is the case where the cost was
worth paying.

`nm_16000` and `nm_17000` were already one duplication group, and both were Complex Method
at cc 10. Each opens by reading the settled lever direction and picking one of three
landing states, differing only in which three. Extracting that block from both makes
exactly the twin pair the rule warns about - `enter_jump_from_16000` and
`enter_jump_from_17000` are duplicates of each other - and the score still went **7.14 ->
7.55**, because two Complex Methods left the review and only one duplication pair arrived,
into a group that already existed.

The test to apply before making the split:

- **How many smells does it clear?** Two Complex Methods is worth a duplication pair; one
  Bumpy Road usually is not.
- **Was the group already there?** Adding a pair to a group of fifteen functions moves the
  duplication finding hardly at all. Creating the *first* duplication group in a clean file
  is what costs.

Measure it either way - the two cases differ by less than half a point and neither is
predictable from reading the code.

---

### Choose which arms to extract so no two dispatchers end up bare

*Overall Code Complexity is a whole-file average* says to extract until the mean
drops. `plpatuni.c` shows the constraint that comes with it: **an extraction
shrinks its caller, and a state machine shrunk to nothing but `case N: helper(wk);
break;` looks exactly like every other state machine shrunk the same way.**

Measured, three ways, on the same file:

| Set | Extractions | Score | What held it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| none | - | 9.38 | Overall Code Complexity |
| all seven bumpy arms | 7 | **9.09** | Code Duplication across five bare dispatchers |
| the same set minus two | 4 | **10.00** | nothing |

The seven-arm set cleared the mean and lost more than it gained. Two of its
extractions emptied `Att_SHOURYUUKEN` and `Att_SENPUUKYAKU`, which then matched
three dispatchers that were already skeletons, and CodeScene raised a five-function
duplicate group. Leaving those two arms inline cost nothing - four extractions
were already enough for the mean - and no family formed.

So when a file is a set of sibling state machines and the finding is the mean:

1. Count how many extractions the mean actually needs before doing any. It is
   usually fewer than the number of arms that could be extracted.
2. Spend them on the machines that are **least** like their siblings - a distinct
   label set, a distinct opening - and leave the near-twins holding their arms.
3. If the duplicate family forms anyway, check whether Recipe S can separate the
   twins **before** reverting. In `plpatuni.c` it could not: the openings the
   siblings share, `begin_uni_attack` and `begin_uni_attack_at_row`, are `static`
   and called from every part of the file, so no cut avoids widening a `static`.
   That is forbidden outright, which made the smaller extraction set the only way
   through.

---

### Against a twin family, share what they agree on before you split what they do not

*Choose which arms to extract so no two dispatchers end up bare* says to spend the
mean's extractions on the machines least like their siblings. There is a better move to
try first, and it broke three plateaus this campaign had written off.

**A twin family has two kinds of material in it.** The arms are near misses - they differ
in a state number, a table, an operator - and lifting one makes another twin. But the
*runs inside those arms* are very often identical, character for character, across the
whole family: an opening, a marker, a launch tail. Those cost nothing to share, because
the helper has exactly one definition and so has nothing to twin with, and each one still
counts in the denominator of the mean.

So the order is: **Recipe C and Recipe D over the shared runs first, and only then Recipe E
over whatever arms the mean still needs.** Every shared run you take is one fewer arm you
have to risk.

Measured on three files whose notes all said the smells could not both be cleared:

| File | Was | Now | What the runs were |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `plpdm_states_late.c` | **10.00** | *was 9.38.* Three shared runs and one ordinary extraction |
| `plpdm_states.c` | **10.00** | *was 9.38.* Six shared runs, no arm lifted - see *Against a twin family, share what they agree on* |
| `plpat07.c` | **10.00** | *was 9.38.* One shared opening changed the count of arms needed from five to four, and four could be chosen to miss the twins |

`plpat07.c` is the clearest statement of why it works. Three separate five-extraction sets
had been measured there, each clearing the mean and each landing back on 9.38 with a new
duplicate pair. One shared opening changed the count needed from five to four, and four
was few enough to take only from the machines with no close relative.

**Finding the runs is mechanical.** Search the file for repeated contiguous line
sequences - two lines up to six or so, indented, inside function bodies - and rank them by
how many copies each has. Anything with two or more copies and no differences is a Recipe C
candidate; anything differing in one value is Recipe D's.

A caveat worth stating: where a run is shared across a **Recipe S split**, each file needs
its own `static` copy, because widening a `static` to bridge the two is forbidden.
`plpdm_states.c` and `plpdm_states_late.c` carry three such pairs. That is real duplication
that the metric does not see, and it is the price of the split rather than a reason to
avoid it.

### For the file mean, move branches - do not just remove lines

*Overall Code Complexity is a whole-file average* says the mean moves when you add a
function. True, but it is only half of it, and the half that matters less.

The mean is total cyclomatic complexity over function count. A Recipe C extraction of a
run of **straight-line** code adds one to the denominator and nothing to the numerator,
so it moves the mean by about `mean / n`. On a nine-function file that is not enough, and
two of them in a row will still measure flat.

Measured on `end_11.c`, whose only finding was the mean:

| Move | Score |
| --- | --- |
| a four-copy shared run, cc 1 helper | 9.38, flat |
| plus a three-copy shared run, cc 1 helper | 9.38, flat |
| plus lifting a cc 7 inner `switch` out of the largest function | **10.00** |

The third move adds a function *and* takes six branches out of the function that was
carrying them. That is what the mean responds to.

So when a file is left with Overall Code Complexity alone, **look for the largest
function and split its branching**, rather than hunting more duplicate runs. `end_13.c`
and `end_03.c` cleared the same way, each on a single extraction from the heaviest
function in the file.

### Chain Recipe X through successive defaults when the labels alone are the floor

*Recipe X pays only if both halves come in under the threshold* says to divide the arm
count before splitting. `sound3rd.c`'s `latch_bgm_request` is the case where one division
is not enough and the answer is not to give up but to divide again.

It had **eleven** case labels, which puts a floor of cc 12 under it: no extraction,
predicate or dedup reaches a label. One split leaves nine labels on one side and is still
flagged. Two do not:

| Function | Keeps | cc |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `latch_bgm_request` | 5, 7, `default:` -> | 5 |
| `latch_bgm_play_request` | 9, 2, 4, `default:` -> | 7 |
| `latch_bgm_simple_request` | 6, 0, 1, 3, 8, the original `default:` | 7 |

Each helper switches on the same expression and keeps the original labels, and each level
is reached from the level above's `default:`, so the chain is Recipe X applied twice rather
than anything new. **9.58 -> 10.00**, and all three came in under the threshold.

Two things make a chain like this legal rather than merely tidy, and both want checking
before the first cut:

- **Every fallthrough stays inside the function that holds both its ends.** Here 5 falls
  into 7, 9 falls into 2/4, and 0/1/3/8 fall into the terminal `default:` - three pairs,
  and the split points were chosen so that no pair is separated. A cut through a
  fallthrough is not a Recipe X split, it is a rewrite of the control flow.
- **Only the outermost switch may keep a side effect in its expression.** The original
  switched on `bgm_req.kind = rmc->bank`; the helpers switch on `bgm_req.kind` alone,
  because the assignment has already happened and nothing on the path to a helper touches
  it. Repeating the assignment at each level would run it three times.

Where the chain's last level inherits the original `default:`, the caveat in Recipe X's
shared-arm variant does not bite: the values that used to reach that `default:` still reach
it, having matched nothing on the way down.

### Extraction stops where the next cut would create a twin

*Added 2026-09-18, measured across `win_pl.c` and the two `appear` files.*

Recipe E lifts a bump into a named function. Do it to two sibling state machines and you
have not removed complexity, you have **manufactured a Code Duplication pair** - and
CodeScene charges more for the pair than it credits for the cyclomatic complexity. This is
the single most common way a legal extraction measures negative, and it is invisible until
you run the review.

Three measurements, all reverted:

| Attempt | Result | What happened |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Win_11000`, whole `case 0:` arm lifted | **-0.15**, then **-0.30** on a second cut | `start_win_11000_pose` became a near copy of `start_win_10000_pose`, and `Win_11000` itself joined the thin-dispatcher group. Two new duplication groups |
| `Appear_05000`, both bumps lifted | **-0.39** | `launch_appear_05000` and `land_appear_05000` read as duplicates of `Appear_04000`'s pair |
| `Appear_36000`, both bumps lifted | **-0.50** | its state-2 launch reads as a duplicate of `launch_appear_26000` |

Three ways out, in order of preference:

1. **Cut shallower.** Lift only the inner chunk, not the whole arm. `Win_11000` measured
   **+0.24** when only `choose_twelve_win_pose` came out and the arm stayed.
2. **Follow through with Recipe F.** If the twin is unavoidable, make it total: extract
   *every* sibling's arm, then collapse the identical shells behind one function pointer.
   That is what took `lose_pl.c` and `win_pl.c` to 10.00, and the intermediate Recipe E
   commit measures flat or negative on its own - `win_pl.c`'s six pose starters read
   **3.94 -> 3.74** before the collapse took the pair to **4.05**. Commit the two steps
   separately and say in the message that the first is half of a pair.
3. **Split instead of extract.** Where the twin is a whole arm, Recipe X moves it without
   creating a function that resembles anything: `Appear_36000` measured **+0.07** as a
   chain that put its two bumps in two levels, after lifting them had measured -0.50.

**The corollary: measure the pair, not the step.** Rule 2 says re-measure after every
commit, and that still holds - but when a step is knowingly half of an E-then-F pair, judge
the pair and record both numbers in the commit message so the intermediate is not later
reverted as dead weight.

### Function work stops paying while the file is over its size threshold

*Added 2026-09-18, measured on `win_pl.c` and `appear.c`.*

*Recipe S is the last recipe you apply, never the first* is written to stop agents splitting
a file they have not yet simplified. It is not a reason to grind a file that is **still over
the Lines of Code threshold** through a dozen marginal extractions.

While that finding is open, an extraction pays about what it costs: `win_pl.c` returned
+0.15 to +0.20 a step from 3.56, and then turned negative - the LoC finding was open, and
every helper added lines to a file already over. After three Recipe S splits took it under,
the very same kind of extraction returned +0.2 to +0.5 a step. `appear.c` is the sharper
case: `Appear_07000` measured **flat** before the split and the same shape of work measured
**+0.22 to +0.47** after it.

So: clear the function-level findings that are *cheap* - the deduplications, the predicates,
the one or two genuinely huge functions - and then **check whether the file is still over its
size threshold before grinding on**. If it is, the split is the next move, not the tenth
extraction. `appear.c` was 1593 lines and its split alone measured **6.02 -> 7.50**.
### Recipe A clears one finding, not fifteen

*Added 2026-09-18, measured on `sc_sub.c`.*

Excess Number of Function Arguments is reported **per function but scored as one
finding**. `sc_sub.c` had fifteen functions over the threshold, and converting them is
naturally four or five commits - so four of those commits measure **exactly flat** and only
the last one moves the score, by 0.50 all at once. An agent applying rule 2 commit by
commit will revert the first conversion and never discover this.

So: when you start a Recipe A campaign, **count the flagged functions first and commit to
finishing them**. Say in each commit message how many are left, so a flat score reads as
progress rather than failure. This is the *measure the pair, not the step* rule with a
longer horizon.

**Rewrite the call sites mechanically, not by hand.** This matters more for Recipe A than
for any other recipe in the catalogue, and the reason is that **the guard cannot see the
error you are most likely to make**. `refactor_guard.py` compares the multiset of literals;
a compound literal with two fields transposed contains exactly the same values, so it
reports `OK`. Types often will not catch it either - `scfont_put`'s `cx` and `cy` are both
`u8`. Parse each call's argument list on top-level commas and wrap the leading *n* verbatim.

Two hazards a script hits that a human editor also hits, but silently:

- **String literals contain commas.** `"@CAPCOM U.S.A., INC. 1999, 2004 ALL RIGHTS
  RESERVED."` splits into three arguments under a naive comma scan. Track quotes, and
  assert the argument count per call so a mis-parse stops rather than corrupts.
- **Re-running the conversion.** A second pass over an already-converted file wraps the
  wrapper. Skip any call whose first argument already begins with `&(`.

The payoff is worth the care: **7.72 -> 8.22** on `sc_sub.c` for the fifteenth function,
and the same push took `sc_sub_combo.c` 8.14 -> 8.39 and unblocked an extraction that would
otherwise have landed straight back on the finding it was trying to clear.

### A varying subscript is not a varying literal

*Added 2026-09-18, on `sys_sub.c`'s `Convert_User_Setting`.*

Recipe V takes a family whose instances differ only in literals. It is tempting to read
"literal" loosely, and this function is the case that shows why you must not. Its eight
button blocks are identical apart from two things:

```c
    if (sw & SWK_WEST) {
        answer |= Convert_Data[save_w[Present_Mode].Pad_Infor[PL_id].Shot[0]];
    }
```

- `SWK_WEST` is **tested** where the block tested that same constant, which Recipe V allows
  in as many words.
- `Shot[0]` is a **subscript**. Recipe V forbids a helper indexing with a parameter, and
  that ban is not bureaucratic: such a helper is choosing which pad slot to read.

The tempting escape is to hoist the whole `Convert_Data[...]` read to the call site and
pass the *value*, which leaves the helper testing one parameter and returning the other -
Recipe V's shape exactly. **That is still refused, on the purity precondition.** The
original evaluates that read only when the button bit is set; hoisting it evaluates it on
every call. It reads plain memory and calls nothing, but whether `Shot[N]` is always in
range for `Convert_Data[12]` is a property of saved pad configuration that this file does
not establish, and Recipe V says to leave a family alone when the hoisted operand *could
trap*. An out-of-range read that used to happen only on a button press would start
happening every frame.

The function stays at cc 10, which is the right answer. A refusal you can state is worth
more than a merge you cannot justify.

### A file can be too big for its own mean

`plmain.c` is the case that shows what *Overall Code Complexity is a whole-file average*
means in practice. At 1430 lines and 65 functions its mean was 4.4 against a threshold near
3.8, and **one extraction moves a 65-function mean by about 0.01**. Three good extractions
measured flat. Two more measured **8.03**, because in a file that size there is always
something for a new helper to twin with, and past 1400 lines *Lines of Code in a Single
File* is waiting as well.

Three Recipe S splits fixed it, in this order, and none of them moved the score on its own:

| Split | plmain.c after | What it took to clear the new file |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the port's super-art states -> `plmain_ps2_arts.c` | 1203 lines, 9.38 | 4 extractions, 9.38 -> 10.00 |
| the vitality drain -> `plmain_vital.c` | 1051 lines, 9.38 | 2 extractions, 9.38 -> 10.00 |
| the gauges and CPS3 arts -> `plmain_arts.c` | 606 lines, 9.38 | 4 extractions, 9.38 -> 10.00 |

Then the three extractions that had measured flat in the 65-function file took what was
left of `plmain.c` from 9.38 to **10.00** unchanged. Nothing about them got better; the
denominator got smaller.

**So when a file shows only Overall Code Complexity, count its functions before extracting
anything.** Under about twenty, two extractions will clear it - `bbbscom.c` and
`manage_result.c` each took one commit. Over about forty, extraction is the wrong tool and
the file needs splitting first.

One more thing a split does, worth knowing because it flatters the score: **a duplication
pair in different files is not a duplication finding.** `sag_union_0` and
`sag_union_ps2_active` are two dispatchers that share a shape and agree on nothing else;
the first split put them in different files and the finding went away without a line of
either changing. Say so in the commit message when it happens - it is a real improvement in
how the code is organised, but it is not the detector being satisfied by better code.

### Widen the family search before you decide a family is too small

*Added 2026-09-18, measured on `Game/com/passive`.*

Recipe V and Recipe D both ask how many instances a family has, and the answer depends
entirely on where you looked. Nothing in either recipe says a family lives in one file,
and in `Game/com/passive` almost none of them do.

The twenty files there are one shape written out 3488 times - a pattern function that
switches on the CPU script's step counter and runs one engine call per step. Folding
per file found 25 families in `pass14.c` and covered 122 of its 254 functions. The same
search run across all twenty files at once found **889 of the 1964 that were left**,
because the step sequences recur between characters: thirteen of the twenty share one
pattern that is a walk then a normal attack, and it is the same fifteen lines in all
thirteen.

The mechanics are unchanged - every varying argument still written out at its own call
site, types still copied from the callee's own prototype - and the skeletons go in a
shared file with a header. They are not `static`, and that is the same latitude Recipe S's
2026-09-18 exception grants, for the same reason: the helper is this campaign's own, its
body is the verbatim block it was extracted from, and each call site already ran those
lines inline.

**Order matters, and the wrong order costs a commit.** Folding per file first and folder-
wide second leaves every character holding its own copy of any skeleton its own scripts
used three times: twenty copies of `pattern_jump_attack_term`, nineteen of
`pattern_normal_attack`. 253 of the 339 per-character skeletons turned out to be
byte-identical to another character's, parameter list included, and a Recipe D pass
collapsed them to 22 shared definitions. **Fold at the widest scope you can reach first**,
and the Recipe D pass is not needed at all.

**Re-run to a fixpoint.** Specialising a family (below) changes which functions are left
over, so a second pass sees families the first could not. On the passive folder the second
pass found one more family of nineteen and the third found nothing.

### When a fifth value varies, specialise - do not reach for a parameter object

*Added 2026-09-18, measured on `Game/com/passive`.*

Recipe V stops where the varying values would make the helper take more than four
parameters, and *Recipe A clears one finding, not fifteen* is standing next to it offering
a parameter object. On a big family that trade is usually wrong: a struct type per
skeleton is a new declaration in a shared header for every one of them, and the struct
exists only to get around an argument-count threshold.

The cheaper move is to stop generalising. Parameterise the three slots that keep the most
members together and **write the remaining values into the skeleton**, specialising the
family into several. Where a fourth varying value takes one spelling across most of a
family and another across a handful, the family becomes one skeleton for the majority and
leaves the rest as they were - a sub-group of fewer than three members is not folded at
all, because Recipe V's three-instance rule applies to the sub-group and not to the
family it came from.

On the passive folder, 499 functions were in families the fold had refused for this
reason. Specialising recovered **378 of them into 69 skeletons**, with no struct types and
no fifth parameter, and took the folder mean from 8.25 to 8.68.

The safety argument does not change, because specialising *removes* generality rather than
adding it. A value written into the skeleton is a value that was there before at every one
of that skeleton's call sites.

### Build the inverse check when the guard cannot see the mistake you will make

*Added 2026-09-18, measured on `Game/com/passive`.*

*Recipe A clears one finding, not fifteen* already records that `refactor_guard.py` cannot
see a compound literal with two fields transposed: the multiset of literals is identical.
The passive folder is that hazard at scale - 3488 functions whose entire content is call
arguments, most of them compound literals, all of them moving to a call site - and the
answer there was not care, it was a second checker.

`tools/passive_fold.py verify` rebuilds the **step -> statement map** of every pattern
function on both sides of a change, inlining the campaign's own helpers again, and diffs
them. Swapping two fields of one `Branch_Menu_Args` at one call site is reported as

    DIFFERS Passive14_0122
       step 0
         before: Com_Random_Select(wk, &(Branch_Menu_Args){6, 0x71, 0x71, 0x72, 0x73}, 2); break;
         after:  Com_Random_Select(wk, &(Branch_Menu_Args){6, 0x71, 0x71, 0x73, 0x72}, 2); break;

It follows a Recipe S split, a rename, a specialised skeleton and a file the split removed,
because it reads the old side from git and the new side from the group you name.

**The lesson is general.** When a transformation is mechanical enough to be scripted, the
inverse is usually mechanical too, and a checker that reconstructs the original from the
result is worth more than any amount of reading. It is worth the most exactly where
`replay_verify.sh` cannot reach - the passive folder is CPU AI, which replay verification
excludes by design, so the mechanical equivalence check *is* the verification.

Two failure modes to design out, both of which this checker hit and reported rather than
passing silently:

- **Parsing that quietly skips.** A wrapped signature, a `void (*step)(PLW*, s16)`
  parameter whose name is not the last word of its declaration, and a call whose arguments
  clang-format put one per line each made it skip a function. A checker that skips is worse
  than no checker. Give it a count to print - "3488 pattern functions, 0 differ" - so a
  number that drops is visible.
- **A pipeline that hides the exit code.** `verify ... | tail -1` returns tail's status.
  Two commits were made on a check that had actually failed. Capture the status.

### Where `Game/com/passive` stopped, and what was refused to get there

*Added 2026-09-18.*

Twenty character files, 3488 pattern scripts, **4.90-7.55 before, 77 files at a mean of
9.03 after**, thirty of them at 10.00 and the lowest four at 7.55. (The figure was 8.79
over 76 files until the identical-body pass below found 130 more.) The sequence was Recipe V per file, Recipe X on
the dispatches over the complexity threshold, Recipe S to get under the function-count
threshold, then Recipe V folder-wide, Recipe D on what that exposed, and Recipe S again on
the shared skeletons.

What is left, and why no recipe in the catalogue reaches it:

- **548 pattern scripts are left unfolded**, of which 282 are one of a kind and **176 are
  in families of exactly two** that Recipe V's three-instance rule refuses. A script that is
  a switch on the step counter with one call per step is more than 75% skeleton, so
  CodeScene pairs any two of them, and a file's score tracks how many of its functions are
  in such a pair almost exactly: 0 is 10.00, 3-4 is 9.38, 5-6 is 9.09, 10-12 is 8.28, 13 or
  more is 8.03. Merging two one-of-a-kind scripts would be parameterising two or more
  differences, which is Recipe D's forbidden near-miss; merging the pairs is the open
  question, and here it is worth 176 functions.
- **A file of three-arm skeletons has a mean of five however it is cut.** A skeleton's
  cyclomatic complexity is its step count plus two, so `pass_patterns_3step.c` and
  `pass_patterns_4step.c` sit at 7.55 on Overall Code Complexity and no legal recipe takes
  a branch out of a switch that is already the smallest form of what it does. Grouping the
  shared skeletons by exact step count is the most that grouping can do, and it is worth
  doing: it puts the one- and two-step files under the threshold.

**What the verification was.** `tools/passive_fold.py verify` on every commit -
3488 pattern functions, 0 differ - plus `refactor_guard.py --combined` and `--calls
--combined` over the whole folder as a group, and the build. Replay verification was run
once at the end against the branch point, 12 seeds x 1800 frames, and came back identical.
That result says nothing about the CPU scripts themselves, which it excludes by design;
what it is worth is the confirmation that nothing outside the folder moved, which is the
one thing the equivalence checker cannot tell you.

Three things were measured and **refused**:

- **Recipe F.** The families whose step sequence matches but whose engine call does not
  cover 60 of the residual, in 13 skeletons. Measured on one file before the folder-wide work it
  moved the score not at all - 8.03 to 8.03, duplication 24 to 18. Recipe F is the
  catalogue's one genuinely high-risk recipe, it reroutes a call through a pointer, and
  replay verification cannot reach CPU AI. 60 functions is not worth that. The measurement
  is reproducible: `tools/passive_fold.py ffold`.
- **Splitting finer.** Cutting the character files to about 17 functions each takes the
  average from 8.03 to roughly 8.6, because *a duplication pair in different files is not a
  duplication finding*. It removes nothing. The files are already under both thresholds and
  cutting them again would only hide the pairs, so the split stops where the thresholds do.
- **Grouping the shared skeletons by their opening call instead of by step count.** It is
  at least as plausible a theme - all the patterns that begin with a walk together - and it
  measures **7.55 on all five files**, against 8.03, 8.03, 8.81, 7.55, 7.55, 7.55, 10.00,
  8.03, 10.00 for the nine by-step-count files. Step count is the better theme here for a
  reason worth remembering: it is the only property of a skeleton that its complexity is a
  function of, so grouping by it is the one grouping that can put any file under the file
  mean threshold at all.
- **Rebalancing the splits after the fold.** The folds shrank the character files by two
  thirds, which leaves some tails small - `pass11_5.c` is two functions. Re-cutting each
  character's files to even sizes was measured and **costs**: `pass11` goes from
  8.28/8.03/9.09/8.03/10.00 to four files at 8.03, `pass18` from a mean of 9.48 to 8.95.
  The uneven tail is the honest residue of a size-based cut made before the folds, not a
  boundary chosen to flatter the metric, and rule 2 says leave it.

### The family where nothing varies is Recipe D, and a Recipe V fold will skip it

*Added 2026-09-19, measured on `Game/com/active` and then on `Game/com/passive`.*

A fold that looks for families differing only in the arguments of their calls has a blind
spot exactly where the work is easiest: the families where **nothing** differs. Those are
not near-misses to be parameterised, they are byte-identical bodies, and Recipe D takes
them with no parameters at all and no three-instance rule.

Measured: 29 groups and 127 functions in `Game/com/active`, and - after the same check was
run there - **30 groups and 130 functions in `Game/com/passive`**, which five earlier
commits had walked straight past. Collapsing them took the passive folder from a mean of
8.79 to **9.03** and doubled the files at 10.00 from eighteen to thirty.

So when a fold reports the families it found, **have it report the ones it refused and
why**. The passive folder's residue looked like an honest plateau for a week; a count of
the refusals would have shown a quarter of it was the easiest merge in the catalogue.

One naming case falls out of it: a script with no steps at all - the switch whose only arm
is the default that ends the pattern - has no step sequence to be named after. Call it
what it is (`pattern_end_immediately`) rather than letting the generator produce
`pattern_` with nothing after the underscore.

### A mutated parameter cannot become a `const` field

*Added 2026-09-19, measured on `PPGFile.c` and `ck_pass.c`.*

Recipe A says to read each parameter as a field of a `const` object. Where the function
**assigns to the parameter**, that will not compile - and the fix that first suggests
itself, dropping the `const`, is a behaviour change: the caller's compound literal is a
temporary, and writing through it writes to something the caller can still read.

The right move is the one the original already made. A by-value parameter's mutations were
local, so give it a local copy off the field and adjust that:

```c
s32 ppgSetupPalChunk(Palette* pch, const PPGPalChunkArgs* a) {
    /* The original took this by value and counted it down; the copy keeps
     * that local, which is what a by-value parameter was. */
    s32 num = a->num;
```

This is not rare. **Six of the ten** conversions in `PPGFile.c` needed it -
`ppgSetupPalChunk` counts a chunk count down, `ppgSetupPalChunkDir` and
`ppgSetupTexChunkSeqs` advance a source pointer, and the three quad writers reassign the
data list when the caller passes NULL - as did `Check_Limited_Attack` in `ck_pass.c`,
which adjusts its limit per opponent.

**Detect them, do not list them.** Three rounds of reading the code and guessing which
parameters were mutated got it wrong three times; a scan of the body for `f =`, `f +=`,
`f++` and their kin gets it right. The compiler catches every miss, but only because the
struct is `const` - which is the argument for making it `const` even where nothing yet
assigns to it.

### Anchor a definition rewriter at column zero

*Added 2026-09-19, on `PPGFile.c`.*

A script that rewrites a function's *definition* must match a return type at the start of
a line. Allowing leading whitespace lets the type pattern match the indentation of a
**call** site instead, and `name(args)` followed by `{` then matches a call whose last
argument is a compound literal - so

```c
    ppgChangeDataEndian(mltAdrs, &(PPGEndianArgs){ mltSize, ... });
```

is rewritten as though it were a definition, giving `ppgChangeDataEndian(mltAdrs, const
PPGEndianArgs* a){ mltSize, ... });`. The build catches it, loudly. The same applies to a
declaration in a header, which is why these scripts should match `^type name(...)` and
treat everything indented as a call.

### Where `Game/com/active` stopped

*Added 2026-09-19.*

The `passive` folder's twin: twenty files, 1621 scripts, 29,006 lines, spelled
`Pattern14_0122` behind a `Computer14` dispatcher but otherwise the same switch on
`CP_Index[wk->wu.id][0]`. **5.04-8.03 before, 27 files at a mean of 8.64 after.**

It was done in the order the passive folder's notes recommend rather than the order the
passive folder actually took, and that is the whole finding worth recording:
**folder-wide fold first**, then Recipe X on what is still over the complexity threshold,
then Recipe S, then the identical-body pass. Going widest-first folded 1233 of 1621
scripts in one commit and left no per-character skeletons to clean up afterwards - the
passive folder needed a 229-copy Recipe D pass for exactly that reason.

What stops it is what stops the passive folder. 272 scripts are left unfolded: **173 are
one of a kind**, 74 are in families of exactly **two** - which Recipe V's three-instance
rule refuses, and which is the open question this playbook has been carrying since
2026-09-17 - and 25 are in families of three or more whose surplus varying values will not
specialise into sub-groups of three. Past that, a file of three-arm skeletons has a mean of
five however it is cut, and the character files are already under both size thresholds, so
splitting them further would only separate duplication pairs without removing them.

**That 74 is the number to put to the owner.** It is the first time the two-instance
question has had a price attached on this scale: answering it would reach a further 27% of
what is left here, and the equivalent share of the passive folder.

### Where `Game/com/active` stopped the second time, and the four refusals

*Added 2026-09-19, after the folder was asked to go past its 8.64 plateau.*

The plateau recorded above held for one reason: **a family was looked for inside one
folder at a time.** `Game/com/active` and `Game/com/passive` are the same shape under two
names, and each had been given its own shared skeleton module - forty of whose skeletons
stood byte-identical to one another across the two. A script that is one of a kind among
its own character files very often has partners in the other folder.

The sequence that moved it, each step verified by `passive_fold.py verify --family com`
re-expanding all 5109 pattern functions:

1. **Recipe V at two instances**, active folder only - 72 scripts onto 36 skeletons.
   8.64 -> 8.91.
2. **Recipe S**, `active_patterns_*.c` and `pass_patterns_*.c` move to
   `Game/com/patterns/com_patterns_*.c`, resharded by step count. No rename, no body change.
3. **Recipe D**, the forty skeletons both modules held collapse to one definition each.
4. **Recipe V across both folders at once** - 246 scripts onto 120 skeletons. The active
   character files go to **9.27**.
5. **Recipe V between skeletons**: 38 of gfold's specialisations are another skeleton with
   literals baked in. 506 lines go; the patterns module goes 7.76 -> 7.84.

    Game/com/active    22 files, mean 8.64 -> 9.27, at 10.00: 4 -> 10
    Game/com/patterns  12 files, mean 7.84 (the debt both folders now share once)
    Game/com/passive   67 files, mean 9.56

**What a character file's score tracks is the number of functions CodeScene flags**, not
the number of residual switches: 0 flagged is 10.00, 5-6 is 9.09, 7-8 is 8.81, 9 is 8.54,
12 is 8.28, and 18 or more is 8.03. `active16.c` holds seven residual switches and scores
10.00 because no two of them are 75% alike; `active00.c` holds five and scores 9.09
because two pairs are.

Four things were measured and **refused**:

- **Inlining the forwarding skeletons.** Step 5 leaves the specialisation as a one-line
  forwarder. Removing it and writing what it forwarded out at each call site - 38
  skeletons, 406 call sites - moved the score *not at all*, and the guard's fingerprint
  says why it should not: 184 new copies of `8` and 94 of `1`, spread over the call sites.
  A named specialisation holding one literal beats 406 call sites holding it each.
  `passive_fold.py inline` is kept for a family whose forwarder is genuinely empty.
- **Extracting a shared tail (Recipe X for sharing, not for complexity).** 133 shared
  arm-suffixes cover 424 of the 492 residual scripts, which looks like the last big
  family. It is not: a script whose tail moves out still holds a switch, and
  `function_duplication_min_lines_of_code_for_check` is **10** - exactly the size of a
  one-arm switch with a default. Measured on `active07.c`: 26 tails extracted, 8.03 ->
  8.03, and the heads alone in a file of their own also score 8.03.
- **Regrouping the shared skeletons alphabetically**, which mixes step counts and so could
  in principle bring every file under `file_mean_cyclomatic_complexity_warning` (4) -
  the global mean over the 474 skeletons is 3.86. Measured **7.59** against 7.84 for the
  by-step-count grouping.
- **Regrouping them balanced by cyclomatic complexity**, dealing the skeletons round-robin
  from most arms to fewest. **7.55**. This one deserved refusing on its own terms as well:
  a file boundary chosen to average a metric is not an organising principle.

**What is left.** 170 active scripts and 332 passive ones are unfolded, and after the
cross-folder pass they are one of a kind *in both folders together*. Merging two of those
is parameterising two or more differences, which is Recipe D's forbidden case and stays
refused. Past them, the patterns module's floor is the arithmetic of a switch: a skeleton's
complexity is its step count plus two, and no legal recipe takes a branch out of a switch
that is already the smallest form of what it does.

### The last legal lever: bundle a call's arguments rather than reach for a per-skeleton struct

*Added 2026-09-19, after the cross-folder pass, and it narrows - not overturns -
*When a fifth value varies, specialise - do not reach for a parameter object*.*

That note refused a parameter object on a **big family**, where specialising into several
skeletons was the cheaper alternative and a struct type per skeleton would have meant 69 new
declarations. In the residual tail there is no such alternative: 35 families of two to six
members vary in four to seven values *and will not specialise*, because every member differs
in every slot. For them the choice is a parameter object or nothing.

The two forms are not equally good, and the difference is measurable:

| Form | Reach | New types | `Game/com/active` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A struct per skeleton, holding whatever that family happens to vary | 93 members, 30 active | **34** | 9.27 -> 9.38 |
| A struct per **engine call**, holding that call's own arguments | 35 members, 11 active | **7** | 9.27 -> **9.33** |

The second was taken. Each type is named for one engine call and its field order is that
call's parameter order, so it reads as `Command_Attack_Args` and the rest of the engine's
own argument structs already do:

```c
pattern_search_back_term_jump_attack_term(
    wk,
    &(Search_Back_Term_Step){ 0x60, 2, 0x10 },
    &(Jump_Term_Args){-1, -0x7FB8, 8, 0x400, 1, -0x7F90, -1, 0x200});
```

The first was refused for a third of a point: thirty-four grab-bag types, each used two or
three times, each carrying an unrelated set of values because one family happened to vary
in them. That is the declaration-per-skeleton cost the original note was written about.

**A struct parameter is invisible to the equivalence checker until you fix it.** A skeleton
reads `p->Reaction` where the call site wrote `&(Normal_Attack_Step){ 8, 0x10 }`, and
`step_map` substituted parameter names textually, so all 35 folds came back as DIFFERS.
Resolving a field back through the compound literal is what makes the fold checkable, and
the check was confirmed by planting the mistake it exists to catch - `{ 0x60, 0x10, 2 }`
for `{ 0x60, 2, 0x10 }`, which it reports as a differing step. **Do not fold through a
struct until the checker can see through it**; a transposed field is exactly the error a
by-position literal invites, and nothing else in the loop would find it.

### Recipe F reaches 18 of 502, measured

*Added 2026-09-19.*

The passive folder refused Recipe F on one file's measurement (8.03 to 8.03) and on risk.
With both folders folded and the residue at 502 scripts, the reach was measured directly:
abstracting the callees as well as the arguments gives 403 families for 502 scripts, of
which **343 are still one of a kind**, and only **9 families / 18 scripts** come in at three
or fewer varying slots with a callee among them. The refusal was right, and it is now
priced. What defeats it is that two scripts of the same step count rarely share a *signature
sequence*: the engine calls take different argument shapes, so the combinations rarely repeat.

### Two more levers priced against `Game/com/active`, and both refused

*Added 2026-09-19, re-testing the folder's plateau rather than taking it on the record.*

The folder's eleven sub-10.00 files were re-scored directly (`active07.c` 8.03,
`active08.c` 8.03, `active14_2.c` 8.03, `active14.c` 8.28, `active04.c` 8.54,
`active17.c` 8.81) and the plateau holds. **Code Duplication is the only finding left in
any of them** - `active07.c` flags 25 of its 76 scripts, in nested groups that reach 25
members. Two further levers were measured against it:

- **A step table for a uniform-callee script.** A script whose every arm calls the *same*
  engine function with the same signature needs no switch at all: the arguments become a
  `static const` array and a shared helper indexes it by `CP_Index[wk->wu.id][0]`, falling
  through to `End_Pattern`. That removes the flagged shape outright rather than folding it.
  Its reach was counted over all 525 residual scripts in both folders plus the patterns
  module: **35**, of which the largest family is 9 `Normal_Attack` scripts and 16 callees
  have exactly one script each. 490 of the 525 are mixed-callee. Spread over ninety files
  that is under one script per file, and no file loses a duplication group. Refused on
  reach, alongside Recipe F's measured 18 of 502 - and for the same underlying reason: what
  repeats in the residue is the *switch*, never the sequence of calls inside it.
- **Splitting a character file to spread its duplication groups.** Measured on
  `active07.c`, cut at function 38 of 76: the halves score **8.03** and **9.09**, a mean of
  8.56 against 8.03 whole. It pays, and it is refused anyway, on the same ground as the two
  skeleton regroupings above: the cut has no organising principle. Both halves are Ibuki's
  scripts, numbered consecutively, and nothing but the metric decides where 38 falls. A file
  boundary drawn to spread a smell is not a file boundary.

The floor is unchanged and it is the one already recorded: a residual script is a switch
over a step counter whose arms call different engine functions in a different order, and no
legal recipe takes a branch out of a switch that is already the smallest form of what it
does.

### The duplication check ignores constants, so do not give each case its own setter

*Added 2026-09-19, measured twice in the PPGFile family.*

CodeScene's Code Duplication check compares the *shape* of two functions, not their
values: `function_duplication_min_similarity_percentage` is 75 and two bodies that differ
only in their literals are 100% alike to it. Two consequences, both measured:

- **A per-case setter family costs more than the switch it replaces.** The PPG and PPL
  header readers each hold a switch over the colour format, and four of the five layouts
  are written out identically in both. Giving each layout its own setter - five helpers,
  each twelve assignments differing only in constants - deduplicated 48 lines and took
  `PPGFile_context.c` from **9.44 to 8.81**: the five helpers became a duplication family,
  and so did the two switches, which were now `case X: set_pixelformat_X(bits);` twice
  over. Splitting the reader's two switches apart instead, bodies untouched, gave **9.58**,
  and chaining the wide formats through the default arm finished at **10.00**.
- **The same applies to a helper pair that differs only in its element type.** A dot-block
  copier for `u8` and one for `u16` are one shape twice. They are still worth extracting -
  they cleared a Complex Method and six bumps - but expect the pair to be flagged and do
  not try to "fix" it by merging the two behind a width flag.

The rule that falls out: **extract what differs in structure, and leave what differs only
in values inside the switch that chooses between them.** A switch arm is the cheapest
place a constant can live.

### A twin pair of files makes the one-sided extraction rule a file-level rule

*Added 2026-09-19.*

*Between two twin arms, extract from one of them only* was written about two arms of one
function. `PPGFile.c` shows the same effect between two *functions* that are each other's
twin - `ppgCheckTextureDataBe` and `ppgCheckPaletteDataBe`, which end with the same nested
free block over a different type. Extracting both cost the file a band, **9.24 -> 9.09**,
because the two helpers are twins as well. Extracting the texture side alone - the one with
two tables to give back, so the bodies are not the same length - paid: **9.31**.

### A fold that removes simple functions can push the file mean over its threshold

*Added 2026-09-19, measured on `opening_scenes.c`.*

`file_mean_cyclomatic_complexity_warning` is a **mean over the functions in the file**, so
the count of functions is a denominator, and a fold that deletes several simple ones raises
it. Scene 108's four `update_op_108_scene_NN_transition` functions are identical apart
from two scene indices - a textbook Recipe V family, four members, forty lines removed -
and folding them took the file from **9.09 to 8.54**: no duplication finding changed, and
*Overall Code Complexity* came back, because four functions of cc 2 had been holding the
mean down.

The fold was reverted. Two things follow, and they are the same rule seen from both sides:

- **Before folding a family of simple functions, check the file's mean.** A file already
  near 4 cannot afford to lose its cheap functions. The fold is still right when the file
  has room; it was right for the twenty-four scene steps in the same campaign, which
  removed no function at all - it replaced repeated *blocks* with calls, so the denominator
  grew by one instead of shrinking by four.
- **The converse is not a licence.** Adding functions that do nothing but hold a name, to
  pull a mean down, is the denominator trick in the other direction, and it was refused
  earlier on `PPGFile_chunks.c` for that reason. Extract what deserves a name; do not

### Fold the repeated block before you judge a switch too long to chain

*Added 2026-09-19, and it overturns a recorded plateau.*

`Game/opening` was recorded as stopped because "chaining one scene pays and chaining the
next costs" - `op_103_move` measured 6.91 -> 7.42 and `op_107_move` 7.42 -> 6.50. That was
true of the scenes *as they were then*, and it was the wrong conclusion, because the thing
being chained was the wrong thing.

Every scene step was the same eight lines:

```c
    case 3:
        if (gSeqStatus[0] >= op_110_sound[op_w.r_no_2]) {
            advance_opening_step(62);
            op_obj_disp = 1;
            return;
        }

        op_bg_move(61);
        break;
```

Fifty of those across the two scene files, differing in the cue, two scene indices and
whatever else the step starts. Folded onto `opening_cue_step` and two variants - Recipe V,
with every varying value written out at its call site - each arm becomes one line, and the
switches that were "too long to chain" became short enough that chaining them paid:
6.77 -> 9.09 and 7.42 -> 9.09 for the two files.

**The order matters.** Recipe X moves *lines* between functions and cannot make a scene
shorter; Recipe V removes the lines outright. Chaining first spreads the repetition over
more functions, which is why the earlier attempt measured worse each time it was tried
again. So: **when a long switch's arms repeat a shape, fold the shape first and chain only
what is left.** A chain measured before the fold has been measured on the wrong code.

### Three ways a recorded plateau can be wrong, all found in one pass

*Added 2026-09-19, after re-testing four plateaus and overturning three of them.*

A plateau note is a claim about what was measured, and it is worth reading as narrowly as
it was written. Three failed that reading on the same day:

- **A `static` function is not file-scope state.** `mtrans.c` was recorded as having "no
  legal cut left - every seam runs through a shared `static`". Every `static` in it is a
  *function*; the only file-scope variables are two `const` tables that nothing outside
  the file reads. A seam that needs functions declared is the cut PPGFile already took:
  an internal header, nothing widened past the file pair. Splitting the buffer pool out
  cleared the size finding, **7.55 -> 8.03**, and the new file came in at 8.28.
- **A refusal covers the functions it names.** `ck_pass.c` was recorded as stopped on
  `KEN_vs`, `HUGO_vs` and `GILL_vs` being near-misses, which re-diffing confirms. Three
  *area helpers* below them differ in exactly one callee each - textbook Recipe F - and
  had simply never been diffed. **8.03 -> 8.28.**
- **A measurement taken before a fold is a measurement of different code.** See *Fold the
  repeated block before you judge a switch too long to chain*, above: the opening folder's
  "chaining costs" was measured on scenes whose arms were still eight lines each.

The fourth held: `pls03_super_arts.c`'s direct-cancel side was re-tested by extracting the
grounded arm's body, and it cost the file a band (**9.92 -> 9.09**) exactly as the note
said it would, because the extracted helper twins with the airborne one.

**What to do with a plateau note.** Re-measure the file first - the score alone takes
seconds - then read the note for *which functions* it names and diff those yourself. A
note that names a mechanism ("every seam runs through X") is a claim to check, not a
finding to inherit.

### A third script folder, and the fold that reaches an existing skeleton

*Added 2026-09-20, measured on `Game/com/shell`.*

`Game/com/shell` is the third folder of COM pattern scripts and had been missed by every
earlier pass. A shell script is spelled `Shell00_0001` behind a dispatcher called
`Shell00`, and its body is the same switch on `CP_Index[wk->wu.id][0]` with one engine
call per step that `passive` and `active` are made of - so `passive_fold.py` reaches it
with nothing but a new `FAMILY` entry, and its skeletons belong in the same shared module.

Ten files, 117 scripts, **8.28-8.81 before, all ten at 10.00 after**, in two commits.

The first of those needed a new command, and it is the transferable part. **`gfold` only
ever groups the scripts it is handed against each other**, so a script that is one of a
kind in its own folder stays inline even when the body it holds is, character for
character, a skeleton some other folder's fold already produced. `xfold` is that case: it
matches a script against the *existing* shared skeletons and rewrites it as one call.

The test is the one `generalise` already applies between two skeletons - the script and
the skeleton reduce to the same shape with every call argument blanked, every slot the
skeleton did not parameterise holds the same value in both, and each parameter is given
one value - so the safety argument is Recipe V's, unchanged, and no skeleton is created,
renamed or edited. It reached **32 of 117** on the first pass.

The lesson generalises past this folder: after any folder-wide fold, the residue is worth
re-testing against the skeletons *other* folders have since contributed. The 442 skeletons
that existed when the shell folder was first looked at were built by the passive and
active passes, and a quarter of the shell folder was already sitting in them.

### Where `Game/com/patterns` stops, against the published thresholds

*Added 2026-09-20. The first plateau in this campaign priced against CodeScene's own
numbers rather than against a series of experiments.*

`rules_config_list_thresholds` for C is worth calling before arguing about a file mean.
The two that decide this folder:

    file_mean_cyclomatic_complexity_warning        4
    function_duplication_min_lines_of_code_for_check   10
    function_duplication_min_similarity_percentage     75

The shared skeleton module is 14 files and 503 generated skeletons, at a mean of 8.02.
Every file carries **Code Duplication**, and the nine holding skeletons of three steps or
more also carry **Overall Code Complexity**. Both were priced:

- **Overall Code Complexity.** A skeleton's cyclomatic complexity is its switch arms plus
  one, so a file of three-step skeletons sits at exactly 5 and must reach 4. The only
  legal way to take a branch out is Recipe X's shared-tail variant, and the skeletons are
  full of them: 128 agree, character for character, on every arm from some step onwards.
  `passive_fold.py tailsplit` applies it - 22 shared tails, 105 skeletons split - and it
  is a real reduction, folder mean cyclomatic complexity **4.69 -> 4.40**. It is still
  above 4, and **every one of the 14 scores is unchanged**, so it reverts under rule 2.
  The arithmetic says why no variation of it can work: the folder's *own* mean is above
  the threshold, so no arrangement of these functions into files puts them all under it.
- **Code Duplication.** Recipe F, run over all 14 files, folds 57 skeletons onto 25 shared
  ones and moves the mean **8.02 -> 8.02**. That is the passive folder's refusal
  re-measured where it should have been measured - on the skeleton files themselves rather
  than on a character file before the folder-wide work - and it now rests on a measurement
  rather than on a risk judgement.

**Two things that would move the number and are refused.** Both are worth writing down,
because each is a way of making CodeScene stop *looking* rather than making the code
better, and rule 2's "splitting finer removes nothing" is the same objection:

- **Re-bucketing the files to balance the mean.** The by-step-count grouping is recorded
  above as "the one grouping that can put any file under the file mean threshold at all".
  That is not right, and the correction matters: grouping by step count puts the *low*-step
  files under the threshold and guarantees the high-step files sit at the maximum their
  contents allow. A balanced mixture would lower several means at once. It also changes not
  one line of code, and the duplicate pairs it separates are duplicates still.
- **Reformatting an arm onto one line.** A one-step skeleton is eleven lines and a
  duplication check begins at ten. Written `case 0: Foo(wk, p); break;` - which is the
  spelling Recipe X's own example uses - it falls under the threshold and is no longer
  compared against anything. The duplication is not gone; it is unmeasured.

So the folder is recorded at **8.02** with its two findings intact, and the reason is the
first line of this catalogue: what remains is the shape of the idiom, and the idiom is
already the smallest form of what it does.

### Price each cut on its own, not one against both

*Added 2026-09-20, measured on `flps2etc.c`.*

*Between two twin arms, extract from one of them only* gives the rule as
"extract both only if that clears the parent's findings; otherwise extract one".
Two files this pass satisfied that condition and still measured negative, which
means the condition is not the whole test.

`flCreateTextureFromTim2_mem` is the APX loader's twin - a mipmap chain, then a
palette. Doing to it what the previous commit did to APX clears **every** finding
on it, Complex Method, Large Method and Bumpy Road, and measures 8.45 -> **8.34**.
Taken apart:

| What was extracted | Score |
| --- | --- |
| nothing | 8.45 |
| the mipmap chain only | **8.88** |
| the mipmap chain and the palette | 8.34 |

Only one of the two cuts makes a twin. `copy_tim2_mipmaps` is free, because it
and `copy_apx_mipmaps` differ in the pixel address they read *and* in how they
advance the destination - `dst += tex_size` against `dst = &dst[tex_size]` - and
two differences is enough to keep them under the 75% similarity threshold. The
palettes are near-identical and pair immediately.

`flCreateTextureFromBMP_mem` says the same thing from the other side: its two
arms measure 8.95 either way alone and 8.67 together, and there the both-arms
version is *strictly better structurally* - it is the only one that takes the
parent under cc 9 - and still loses.

So the question is not how many cuts clear the parent. It is **which cut makes
the twin**, and the only way to know is to apply them one at a time and measure.
Three runs of `tools/ch.py --review` cost seconds; guessing costs a revert.

### What the equivalence checker cannot see, and what to do instead

*Added 2026-09-20, after `tools/inline_equiv.py` reported DIFFERS six times in
one session and was right once.*

`inline_equiv.py` is the only check in this campaign that catches a
transposition, so a DIFFERS has to be read rather than obeyed. Four shapes make
it report a difference that is not one, and one of them is a real trap:

- **A parameter named after a field the helper writes.** `clear_pad_slot(s32 i,
  s32 state)` writing `ps2slot[i].state = state` re-expands to
  `ps2slot[i].1 = 1`, because the substitution is textual. This is the trap:
  the tool is not merely noisy here, it is **blind** - it would miss a genuine
  transposition in the same function. Rename the parameter (`new_state`) and the
  check works. **Never give a helper parameter the name of a field it writes.**
- **A value-returning helper used inside an `if`.** The tool substitutes a body
  for a call statement, which cannot be done for `if (helper(i) == 0)`. This is
  every Recipe C 0/1 helper. Check it by enumerating the block's exits instead:
  every `return` in the original maps to one value, falling off the end maps to
  the other, and the caller branches. That enumeration *is* the proof.
- **A declaration that moved.** An extraction that takes `s32 lp0` or
  `u8 rdata[32]` with it leaves the tool comparing bodies that differ by a
  declaration. Re-inline by hand with the declaration put back.
- **A by-address parameter.** Substituting `s16* axis` with `&stick[0].x` yields
  `*&stick[0].x`, the same lvalue and not the same text. Cancel the pair.

The hand re-inlining is fifteen lines of Python each time and it is worth
writing: a `difflib` opcode dump over the whitespace-normalised bodies says
*identical* or names the difference, which is the answer the tool was asked for.

### Two ways refactor_guard can pass on code that is wrong

*Added 2026-09-20; both hit in one session.*

- **An unexpanded glob.** `G="src/.../*.c"; refactor_guard.py --combined $G`
  passes the literal pattern, no file matches, and the tool reports
  `OK combined group (0 literals unchanged)` and exits 0. A clean result on an
  empty group looks exactly like a clean result on the real one. If the output
  does not name the files, it did not read them.
- **Syntax.** Halfway through `create_pipeline`'s parameter object the file had
  a correct literal fingerprint, a correct call fingerprint, and four
  assignments missing their `=`. Both guards said PASS. They answer one question
  each and neither is "does this compile", which is why the build comes first in
  the verification sequence rather than last.

### A Recipe T header and its `.c` are checked separately

*Added 2026-09-20, measured on `ps2PAD.c`.*

Recipe T says to name a table's row type in a header so the `.c` gains no
literal. Run the guard on the pair with `--combined` and that careful separation
is undone: the header's added `2` lands in the same multiset as the copies the
`.c` removed, and the tool reports **FAIL - a constant was substituted**.

The two diffs are meant to be different shapes. The `.c` is a deduplication
WARN - counts only dropped, every value still present. The header is the legal
"literals added, none removed". Check them one file at a time; `--combined` is
for a Recipe S split, where whole functions move between files in the group.

### Recipe G may invert a condition. Recipe P may not

*Added 2026-09-20, measured on `flps2etc.c` and `pltim2.c`.*

Two recipes move a condition and only one of them may turn it round, which is
easy to get backwards because the nicer name usually lies on the inverted side.

Recipe P copies the expression character for character, so a guard written
`bitdepth != 3 && bitdepth != 4` becomes `is_unsupported_bitdepth`, not
`!is_direct_colour_bitdepth`. De Morgan gives the same answer and both operands
there are pure reads, so the inversion would have been safe - and it is still
not what the recipe permits. The rule is worth more than the name, because its
value is that the safety argument never depends on the agent's reasoning.

Recipe G is the opposite: inverting the outermost condition and returning early
*is* the recipe. `decode_pic_alpha_row`'s whole body sat inside
`if (context->bitdepth != 3)`, and `if (context->bitdepth == 3) return lpsrc;`
reproduces the fall-through exactly. **9.24 -> 9.84** on its own.

### A plateau note covers the functions it names

*Added 2026-09-20, measured on `cmd_main_checks.c`.*

*Three ways a recorded plateau can be wrong* lists three. Here is a fourth, and
it is the cheapest one to check.

`cmd_main_checks.c` was recorded at 7.50 as "the hardest file left", with the
reason spelled out: the mean needs thirteen more functions, sharing the runs was
tried on `load_waza_command_header` and `command_terminator_reached`, and "every
arm lifted joins one of three families". All of that is true **of the `check_*`
dispatchers the note names**.

The file's worst function was `run_dash_release_states`, at cc 13, and the note
does not mention it. Its three states split at the default with both halves at
cc 7: **7.50 -> 7.77**, on the first thing tried.

So before inheriting a plateau, list the file's flagged functions and check them
against the ones the note discusses. A note is a record of what somebody looked
at, not a proof about what they did not.

### Price the file's cheapest finding before inheriting a plateau

*Added 2026-09-20, measured on `opening_bg0.c`: a plateau recorded at 8.12
"measured twice", taken to **10.00** in nine commits without relaxing anything.*

*A plateau note covers the functions it names* is about a note that missed a
function. This is about a note that looked at the right functions, measured them
correctly, and still reached the wrong conclusion about the file, because it
priced each move against the findings that happened to be open at the time.

`opening_bg0.c` had three findings: **Overall Code Complexity**, **Complex
Method** on two functions, and **Code Duplication** on six. The note priced the
two available moves - lifting `op_bg0_0003`'s inner switch, and splitting
`op_bg0_lay_blocks_6` - and found each clears one of the two Complex Methods
while making a seventh member of the block-laying family: **8.12 -> 8.03** each.
Both true. Both reverted.

What was never priced is the cheapest finding in the file. **Overall Code
Complexity is the file's mean cyclomatic complexity against a flat threshold of
4, and every helper this catalogue creates moves it by the same amount**,
`(mean - 1) / (n + 1)`, whatever the helper contains. That is not a
coincidence: a function's complexity is one plus its branches, so lifting `b`
branches into a helper takes `b` off the parent and gives the helper `1 + b` -
the file's total rises by exactly one and its count by exactly one, for an
extraction of any size and for a straight-line deduplication alike. It is the
one finding that every legal move pays into, including the ones that do nothing
else. So measure it first:

1. **Probe it.** `python tools/mean_probe.py <file>` inserts `k` throwaway
   one-line functions, binary-searches the smallest `k` that closes the finding,
   and puts the file back. It costs three or four score calls and no build -
   CodeScene reads source and never compiles it - and it turns "the mean is too
   high" into a number. For `opening_bg0.c` that number was *two*.
2. **Spend the extractions the file already wants** until that number is met.
   Each one measures flat on its own, which is the trap: rule 2 would revert
   every one of them individually and the finding would never clear. Commit them
   as a declared set, each message naming the one that will carry them. The
   `game_round.c` row in the table above already did this for a single pair -
   "a probe said **two** more low-complexity functions would clear it, so the
   first of the two measures flat and says in its message that the second
   carries it" - and the technique generalises: probe first, then spend.
3. **Then re-price everything that was rejected.** With the mean cleared and
   Complex Method the only category the rejected moves touch, the same lift that
   cost 0.09 measures flat, and it is now worth taking because it removes a
   *category* rather than one of two entries in one.

The order matters more than the moves. In sequence: 8.12 flat, flat, flat, then
8.28 on the chain rebalance, flat on the re-tried lift, flat, **8.81** when the
mean cleared, 9.09, 9.38, **10.00**. Four of the nine commits measured flat and
not one of them was gold-plating.

The last two are worth naming separately, because they are the answer to the
`Recipe D's forbidden case` note that had been written across both `opening_bg`
files. A mirrored pair - `<` against `>`, `+=` against `-=` - can never be
folded. It can still be **broken**, by lifting a block out of *one* side: the
asymmetry drops that side below CodeScene's similarity threshold and both
functions leave the finding. Doing it to both sides puts the pair straight back,
which is why the backlog's `effd1.c` and `effe9.c` rows record 10.00 for one arm
and 9.38 for both.

That is the one-arm rule, and it has a precondition measured in the same week:
see *The one-arm rule needs the arms to differ by more than one expression*.
`op_bg0_0006` against `op_bg0_0013` and `op_bg0_0007` against `op_bg0_0008` both
have daylight to spare - a different scroll field, a different opening, a
different approach - which is why lifting from one side of each worked here.
Diff the arms before spending a commit on it.

**This section and *Count the functions before you extract* are the same
arithmetic read from opposite ends**, and they were written a day apart without
knowing about each other. That one says an extraction on a file of six functions
can *introduce* Overall Code Complexity and cost 0.53; this one says a file
already carrying it can be walked out of the finding by spending extractions it
wanted anyway. Both reduce to: the mean has a divisor, so count the functions
before deciding what an extraction is worth. Probe first and you do not have to
reason about it at all.

### Retry a rejected extraction - including one refused on duplication

*Added 2026-09-20, measured on `cmd_main_checks.c` and `ps2PAD.c`.*

*Retry a rejected extraction once the file has improved* is written about
complexity: a helper that arrived carrying findings of its own may stop doing so
once those have been lifted out separately. `ps2PAD.c`'s `identify_pad` is that
case exactly - refused at 8.13 against 8.37, taken four commits later at 9.19 to
9.24 once its three bumps had gone.

The same rule applies to an extraction refused on a **duplication** measurement,
and that is less obvious, because nothing about the two helpers changes.
`check_19`'s lever chain was priced alongside `check_18`'s and measured **8.22
against 8.74** - the pair they made cost more than the complexity they removed.
Re-priced after `check_1` and `check_10` had been through, the identical cut
measures **8.88 -> 9.16** and clears Complex Method from the file.

The helpers are the same. The file is not. **CodeScene's duplication findings are
relative to the rest of the file**, so a pair that costs half a point next to
four other flagged functions costs nothing next to one. Re-price a duplication
refusal whenever the file's finding count drops, not only when the targeted
function changes.

### Recipe P cannot name a condition inside an assertion

*Added 2026-09-20, measured on `arcade_char_data.c`.*

CodeScene counts the branches of a condition the compiler discards. `read_script`
sits at cc 10 with three of those branches inside

    SDL_assert(cgd_type == 1 || cgd_type == 2 || cgd_type == 4 || cgd_type == 6);

and naming that condition measures **9.53 -> 9.84**. It also does not build. In
this configuration `SDL_assert` expands to nothing, so the predicate is never
referenced and clang rejects it under
`-Werror=-Wunneeded-internal-declaration` - in Debug and Release alike.

There is no legal way out: the branches are real to the metric and unreachable to
the catalogue. Where a function's residual complexity is an assertion, say so and
stop.

### Which side of the mean the file starts on decides whether a fold pays

*Added 2026-09-20, from the same fold measured twice.*

*A fold that removes simple functions can push the file mean over its threshold*
was measured on `pltim2.c`: collapsing four pixel-layout helpers onto one
parameter object cleared Code Duplication and brought Overall Code Complexity
straight back, 8.77 to 8.77.

`flps2vram.c` has the same three layouts, eighteen copies of them, and folding
them there measures **7.36 -> 7.78** with no such trade. The difference is not
the code, it is the starting point: `pltim2.c` was **under** the file-mean
threshold of 4 and removing three cc-1 functions pushed it over, while
`flps2vram.c` was already over it and three cc-1 functions pulled it down.

So the rule has a sign. Before folding simple helpers away, ask which side of the
mean the file is on; before extracting simple helpers, ask the same. It is the
one transformation whose effect on Overall Code Complexity reverses depending on
where the file already stands.

### A lifted block keeps the indentation of the construct it sat in

*Added 2026-09-20, after shipping it wrong.*

A scripted Recipe E that dedents by four is right for a block that sat inside one
`if`, and wrong for a block that sat inside a `switch` arm, a nested brace, or
nothing at all. Two helpers in `arcade_char_data.c` went in with their entire
bodies at column zero and had to be fixed in a follow-up commit.

The reason it survived the gate is worth the note: **the build, `refactor_guard.py`
and `inline_equiv.py` all normalise whitespace**, so none of the three can see
it. Print the function you just made and read it.

### Build every configuration the file has code for

*Added 2026-09-20, measured on `args.c` and `ioconv.c`.*

Three separate things this session hit the same wall:

- A predicate named out of an `SDL_assert` is unreferenced once the assert
  compiles out (`arcade_char_data.c`).
- Three helpers placed just above their caller but **outside** the
  `#if NETPLAY_ENABLED` the caller sits in: the Debug build, which defines it,
  compiled clean, and the default build failed with fourteen errors
  (`args.c`).
- A predicate for a condition inside `#if DEBUG` would be unreferenced in every
  build that does not define `DEBUG` (`ioconv.c`, avoided).

The common rule is short: **a helper lifted out of conditionally-compiled code
belongs inside the same guard as its caller**, and a file with any such code has
to be built both ways. In this repository that is `build` and `build-dbg` - the
Debug one is the only configuration that defines `NETPLAY_ENABLED`, and it is
the one `replay_verify.sh` uses, so building only what the replay gate builds is
not enough.

`-Werror=-Wunneeded-internal-declaration` turns every one of these into a build
failure rather than a warning, which is the good news: the gate catches it, as
long as the gate is run on both configurations.

### `passive_fold.py` does not apply to the skeleton module it writes

*Added 2026-09-20, after running it there and reading the result.*

`passive_fold.py families --min-members 2` over `Game/com/patterns/*.c` reports **twelve
families**, which reads like twelve unfolded Recipe V merges sitting in the lowest-scoring
files in the repository. It is an artefact, and the tool must not be run there.

`find_families` selects functions whose names match `\w+_\d+`, which catches the
skeleton module's own `_2` and `_3` variants, and `skeletonize` then treats every
argument it does not recognise as a varying *literal slot*. That is correct for a COM
script, which takes only `wk` and writes its arguments out as constants. It is wrong for
a skeleton, which already has parameters. Running `fold` on
`com_patterns_3step.c` produced a helper calling `J_Command_Attack(wk, p)` with no `p` in
scope, and wrappers reduced to `(PLW* wk)` whose bodies still referenced the parameters
that had just been removed. It does not compile, and the two functions it merged had
different parameter lists to begin with.

**The check that catches it is reading the diff**, not the build - which is why it is
worth writing down. `refactor_guard.py` would have been happy: no literal changed.

The underlying question - are there genuine Recipe V families among the skeletons? - is a
separate one, and the answer measured by hand is that the promising pair costs more than
it gives. `active_pattern_adjust_attack` and `_2` are byte-identical apart from two
literals, so they qualify; but their skeleton already takes three lever arguments, and a
shared version needs five or six parameters. Code Duplication comes off and Excess Number
of Function Arguments goes on.

### Overall Code Complexity is a file mean, so its unit of work is a group

*Added 2026-09-20, measured on `appear.c`, `effa9.c`, `demo02.c` and
`sc_sub_combo.c`.*

Every other finding in this catalogue belongs to a function, and rule 2 - keep a flat
step only if the targeted function left a category or lost complexity - reads naturally
against it. **Overall Code Complexity does not.** It is the mean cyclomatic complexity
across the file's functions, so no single extraction clears it unless the file was
already on the edge, and a run of perfectly good steps will each measure flat.

Read literally, rule 2 reverts all of them and the finding never goes.

**Work out how many steps it needs before starting.** Extracting a block of *b* branches
into a helper of cc *b+1* moves the file's total by **+1** and its function count by
**+1**, whatever *b* is - including *b* = 0, a block with no branches at all. So from a
file of *n* functions totalling *T*:

    (T + k) / (n + k) < 4      →      k > (T - 4n) / 3

`appear.c` was 53 functions totalling 222, so *k* = 4 and four branch-free extractions
did it: 9.38 -> 9.38 -> 9.38 -> 9.38 -> **10.00**. `effa9.c` needed two, `demo02.c` two,
`sc_sub_combo.c` two.

**Commit them one function at a time anyway**, and say in each message which step of how
many it is and that the mean crosses on the last. The one-function rule is about being
able to revert a single behaviour, and that reason is untouched by the arithmetic. What
changes is only how rule 2 is read: **the flat steps are kept because the group clears a
finding, and the group is measured before the first of them is committed.** If the group
does not clear it, revert all of them.

**Pick blocks that stay under ten lines** where the file has several similar
first-frame or setup blocks. Below `function_duplication_min_lines_of_code_for_check`
they are never compared against each other, so a family of four `begin_appear_*` helpers
costs no Code Duplication finding. Above it, it would.

**And that is exactly where the arithmetic can run out.** `appear_late.c` needs *nine*
steps by the formula above, and the only branch-free blocks it has are nine near-identical
entry setups - `routine_no[3]++`, a display flag, a `set_char_move_init` and
`bg_app_stop`. Lifting six of them brought **Code Duplication** on as a group of six and
measured **9.38 -> 8.54**; lifting three of them paired with nothing and measured **9.38**,
because three is not nine. There is no subset that is both large enough to move the mean
and varied enough not to pair.

So run the count *and* look at what the blocks are before starting. Where a file needs
many steps and its only spare blocks are one idiom repeated, Overall Code Complexity is a
plateau, and the honest record is the two measurements.

### A fold that shortens its call sites can win by not being looked at

*Added 2026-09-20, measured on `flps2vram.c` and reverted.*

`function_duplication_min_lines_of_code_for_check` is 10. The catalogue already
refuses **reformatting** an arm to slip under it, on the grounds that the
duplication is then unmeasured rather than gone. The same thing can happen
without anyone reformatting anything, and it is easy to miss.

The three pixel layouts in `flps2vram.c` are twelve assignments each, identical
apart from the values - a clean Recipe V, three instances, only literals varying.
Folded onto one helper with the values in a `PixelFormat` compound literal, it
measured **8.54 -> 9.09**. Run through `clang-format`, which puts one field per
line, the same code measured **8.54**. Nothing changed but the line count of the
three call sites: at three fields per line each variant is eight lines and is not
compared against anything; at one field per line each is fifteen and the three
literals pair exactly as the three assignment runs did.

Two things follow:

- **Measure in the layout the file is written in.** Format first, then run
  `ch.py`. A score taken before `clang-format` is a score for code that is not
  going to be committed.
- **A duplication group that reappears in the folded form is telling you
  something true.** Three compound literals that differ only in their values are
  as alike as the three runs they replaced; the fold moved the repetition rather
  than removing it. That can still be worth doing for a reader, but it is not
  worth a commit under rule 2, and the honest record is that the file stays where
  it was.

### Recipe G's early exit inside a loop is `continue`

*Added 2026-09-20, measured on `plpat09.c`.*

Recipe G is written about a function: invert the outermost condition and return
early. The same shape occurs one level in, where a loop body is a single `if`
whose whole contents are the iteration's work and whose failure falls through to
the next iteration. There the early exit is `continue`, and it is the same
transformation with the same safety argument - the fall-through the guard
reproduces is the end of the loop body rather than the end of the function.

`place_tenguiwa_set`'s rock loop is the case: `if (num < 36) { ... }` wrapped
seven statements and a `break`, and

    if (!(num < 36)) {
        continue;
    }

measured **9.92 -> 10.00** on its own. Note the negation: the condition is
wrapped whole rather than rewritten as `num >= 36`, so no comparison operator
changes and the rule against touching them is not tested.

**It is not free, and it is not always right.** The same move on
`Lz77Dec.c`'s decoder - three nested arms turned into two `continue` guards -
cleared two of its four bumps and its nesting depth, and measured **flat at
8.81 with cyclomatic complexity up by one**, because each `continue` is a branch
the `else` was not. It reverted under rule 2. Measure it like any other step.

### Type-check the configuration your machine cannot build

*Added 2026-09-20, measured on `core/renderer.c` and `psp_renderer.c`.*

"Build every configuration the file has code for" is easy where both configurations
build here. It is not the whole story for a file whose other branch targets a platform
this machine has no toolchain for. `core/renderer.c` carries an
`#elif CRS_VIDEO_DRIVER_PSP` arm that never compiles on a Mac or a PC, and a Recipe F
fold has to change that arm as well as the one that does.

**`clang -fsyntax-only` with the other configuration's macros forced gets most of the
way there**, provided the branch's own includes are plain headers:

    clang -fsyntax-only -Isrc -Isrc/sdk \
          -DCRS_VIDEO_DRIVER_PSP=1 -DCRS_VIDEO_DRIVER_SDL_GENERIC=0 \
          src/core/renderer.c

That parses the PSP arm and type-checks every call in it against the real prototypes in
`psp_renderer.h` - which is what a function-pointer fold most needs checking, because a
signature mismatch there is the one way Recipe F goes wrong. Run it before committing a
change that touches a branch you cannot build.

**Where it does not reach, do not refactor.** `psp_renderer.c` is one `#if
CRS_VIDEO_DRIVER_PSP` from its first line, and it includes `<libgraph.h>` and the rest
of the PSP SDK, so neither the build nor `-fsyntax-only` can see it. Its
`draw_textured_sprite_rect` takes ten arguments and is an obvious Recipe A, with two call
sites both in the same file - and it stays as it is, because the campaign's first gate
cannot be run on it. Record the finding and move on; that is what "stop and report" is
for.

### A Recipe X split must still name every enumerator

*Added 2026-09-20, measured on `fistbump.c` - and caught by the Debug build,
not by the Release one.*

Splitting a `switch` over an `enum` leaves each half naming only some of the
enumerators. Clang's `-Wswitch` objects to that, and this repository's Debug
configuration turns it into an error:

    error: enumeration values 'FISTBUMP_IDLE', 'FISTBUMP_CONNECTING', and
    'FISTBUMP_SENDING_TOKEN' not handled in switch [-Werror,-Wswitch]

Two things make this worth its own note. The first is that **the Release build
compiled it cleanly**: the difference was the warning flags, not conditional
compilation, so "build every configuration the file has code for" applies to a
file with no `#if` in it at all. The second is the **cost of the fix**: a bare
`default: break;` in the helper satisfies the compiler and is behaviour-neutral -
a value matching nothing did nothing before - but it is one more branch, and on
`fistbump.c` it put the helper back over the Complex Method threshold at cc 9
and the file back from 9.68 to 9.20. Splitting once more cleared it.

So there are two legal shapes, and which one to reach for is a measurement:

- **No default anywhere**, where the parts *between them* name every enumerator.
  That is the cheapest, and it is what `Fistbump_Run` ended up with.
- **`default: break;` in the tail**, where they do not. Expect to pay a branch
  for it, and be ready to split again.

An `event->type` that is a `Uint32` rather than an enum raises none of this;
`sdl_app.c`'s split needed no default at all.

### An else-if prefix chain splits like a switch

*Added 2026-09-20, measured on `fistbump.c`'s command parser.*

Recipe X is written for a `switch`, and its safety argument is that case labels
are mutually exclusive, so a value that used to match an arm in the first half
still matches the same label in the second. A chain of `else if`s over disjoint
prefixes has that property too - `strncmp(line, "SESSION ", 8) == 0` and
`strncmp(line, "MATCH ", 6) == 0` cannot both hold - and the split is the same
move, with the tail reached from the chain's new `else`:

    } else if (strncmp(line, "TOKEN ", 6) == 0) {
        Fistbump_HandleTOKEN(line);
    } else {
        Fistbump_ParseMatchCommand(line);
    }

`Fistbump_ParseCommand` went cc 9 -> 5 and the file **9.38 -> 9.68**.

**The precondition is the exclusivity, and it has to be checked rather than
assumed.** Prefixes where one is a prefix of another - `"MATCH "` and
`"MATCHED "` - are not disjoint, and there the chain encodes an order that
splitting would change. Read the arms before cutting.

### A dispatch shim's entry points group by signature

*Added 2026-09-20, measured on `core/renderer.c`.*

A platform shim is often one dispatch written once per entry point: a guard, and
the backend call this build has. Eleven of those in `renderer.c` differ only in
the pair of backend names, which is exactly Recipe F's relaxed case - except
that Recipe F requires the pointed-to functions to share a signature, and a
shim's entry points do not all share one.

**Group them by signature and fold each group.** Seven `void(unsigned int)`
handle operations folded onto one helper (**8.28 -> 9.38**) and the two
`(const Sprite*, unsigned int)` draws onto another; `DrawSprite2` takes a
`Sprite2*` and `DrawSolidQuad` a `Quad*`, so each is alone and both stay as they
are.

**Define the helper once per configuration rather than once with casts.** The
two backends here spell the handle differently - `Uint32` against
`unsigned int` - and Recipe F forbids casting a function pointer to make two
signatures fit. Writing

    #if CRS_VIDEO_DRIVER_SDL_GENERIC
    static void renderer_handle_op(Uint32 handle, void (*op)(Uint32)) { ... }
    #elif CRS_VIDEO_DRIVER_PSP
    static void renderer_handle_op(unsigned int handle, void (*op)(unsigned int)) { ... }
    #endif

costs a few lines, needs no cast, and puts each definition inside the same `#if`
as the call sites that name it, so neither build carries an unreferenced static.

### Three gates, and what each one is blind to

*Added 2026-09-20, after each of the three passed on something broken.*

The verification sequence is build, `refactor_guard.py`, CodeScene. It is worth
knowing precisely what each one cannot see, because this session got a clean
result from every one of them on code that was wrong:

| Gate | Blind to |
| --- | --- |
| `refactor_guard.py` | **Syntax.** A parameter-object rewrite with four assignments missing their `=` reported OK on literals *and* calls. A slice that left a stray `}` behind reported OK. It answers one question and neither is "does this compile" |
| `refactor_guard.py` | **An empty group.** An unexpanded glob makes it report `OK combined group (0 literals unchanged)` and exit 0 |
| `inline_equiv.py` | **A parameter named after a field it writes** - it substitutes textually and produces `ps2slot[i].1 = 1`, so it would also miss a real transposition there |
| `inline_equiv.py` | **Whitespace**, like the other two - two helpers shipped with their whole bodies at column zero and no gate noticed |
| the build | **Everything about behaviour.** It is the only one that sees syntax, and the only one that sees the other configuration |
| all three | **Indentation, and a duplicated guard** - the second is caught by `refactor_guard.py` only because the copied condition brings its literals with it |

None of this is an argument for fewer gates. It is an argument for reading the
function you just wrote, which is the only check that covers all six rows.

### The guard is a per-commit tool, not a per-session one

*Added 2026-09-20, after running it across a hundred commits and getting eleven
FAILs on work that was clean.*

`refactor_guard.py --base <session start> --all` looks like a good final check.
It is not one, and it reported **FAIL - a constant was substituted** on eleven
files at the end of a session in which every individual commit had passed.

Two separate reasons, both worth knowing:

- **It aggregates recipes whose fingerprints move in opposite directions.**
  `pltim2.c` had five commits: Recipe D removed duplicate copies of literals,
  Recipe X added a `switch` subscript. Each is legal and each passed on its own -
  one as "counts only dropped", the other as "literals added, none removed".
  Summed, some counts fell while others rose, which is exactly the shape the tool
  is built to call a substitution. Checked properly - every literal *value*
  present before the session against every value present after - `pltim2.c` lost
  nothing and gained nothing.
- **It is a per-file view of a change that crossed files.** The ten `shell*.c`
  files genuinely lost `num 3`, `num 9` and `num 32704`, because those values
  moved into the skeletons in `Game/com/patterns` when the folder was folded.
  Over the two folders as one group the multiset is intact: no value present
  before is absent after, and the counts drop only where duplicate copies were
  collapsed.

So: run the guard **per commit**, and over the group the commit touches. If you
want a session-wide sanity check, compare the *set* of literal values rather
than their counts - `set(literals(old)) - set(literals(new))` over every changed
file, with files that share moved code taken together. That is a dozen lines and
it answers the question the FAIL only pretends to.

### Count the functions before you extract

*Added 2026-09-20, measured on `effm2.c`, `effect.c` and `appear_late.c`.*

Overall Code Complexity is the file's mean cyclomatic complexity against a threshold of 4,
so every extraction moves two numbers: the branches it takes out of a function, and the
divisor. On a large file the divisor barely moves. On a small one it decides the result.

`effm2.c` holds **six** functions. Lifting the run/walk choice out of
`place_cat_beside_owner` cleared its Bumpy Road exactly as intended - the guard read OK at
117 literals unchanged - and the file measured **9.84 -> 9.31**, because the seventh
function brought Overall Code Complexity in with it. The same shape of extraction on
`effect.c`, which holds thirty-seven functions at a mean of 2.57, paid three times running
and took the file to 10.00.

So read the function count first. Below about a dozen functions, an extraction that clears
a Complex Method or a Bumpy Road can hand back more than it takes, and the review will show
a category the file did not have before. `eff11.c`, `effa2.c`, `efff6.c`, `plpat00.c`,
`end_01.c`, `effb5.c`, `eff09_init.c` and `netplay_menu.c` are all two to six functions and
all sit in this trap.

The inverse is priced in *A fold that removes simple functions can push the file mean over
its threshold*. Both are the same arithmetic read from opposite ends.

**Where the mean is the only finding, probe before you hunt.** Adding one, two, three, four
and six throwaway functions to `appear_late.c` and re-scoring measures 9.38 every time.
CodeScene reads source and does not need the file to compile, so the probe costs a re-score
and no build.

*Amended 2026-09-20 on the merge with `refactor/halve-the-yellow-band`, which arrived with
`tools/mean_probe.py`.* Six was not enough to conclude with: the binary search says
**eight**, and at eight the file is at **10.00** with nothing else left in it. The reading
"wider than any honest extraction closes" was the search stopping early, not the file
refusing - eight extractions across thirty-eight functions is a session's work, not an
impossibility. Run the probe to a bound rather than to a hunch.

### The one-arm rule needs the arms to differ by more than one expression

*Added 2026-09-20, measured on `sc_sub.c` against `effect.c`.*

*Between two twin arms, extract from one of them only* keeps the win and creates no twin -
**when the arm that stays inline is different enough from the helper that leaves.**

`effect.c`'s `search_effect_index` is the rule working. Its two arms walk `head_ix` with
`->behind` and `tail_ix` with `->before`, four names apart. Lifting the backward arm
measured **10.00 with no findings left**, against 9.09 for lifting both.

`sc_sub.c`'s `scfont_sqput2` is the rule failing. Its two arms are the same doubly-nested
loop and differ in **one sub-expression**, `cx1 + i` against `(cx1 + (cx2 - 1)) - i`.
Lifting the upright arm cleared Bumpy Road and measured **9.31 -> 9.09**: the helper and
the arm left behind are a duplication pair by themselves, so extracting one arm bought
exactly the twin the rule exists to avoid.

Diff the two arms before choosing. One differing expression is not enough daylight.

### An extraction pays when it differentiates and costs when it homogenises

*Added 2026-09-20. The common cause behind six reverts in one session.*

Code Duplication is measured between functions at 75% similarity, so what an extraction
does to a file is decided by whether it leaves functions **less** alike or **more**.

Paying, because it differentiated:

| Change | Score |
| --- | --- |
| `bg_zoom.c`, name the two fighter midpoints | 8.54 -> **8.81** |

The midpoint is written out four times per axis and not at all in some selectors, so
lifting it shortened the flagged functions by different amounts.
`select_horizontal_zoom_request_later` stopped resembling its siblings and left the group -
still 27 lines, so it left by being different rather than by falling under
`function_duplication_min_lines_of_code_for_check`.

Costing, because it homogenised:

| Change | Score |
| --- | --- |
| `bg_zoom.c`, name the fighter position accessor, 17 sites | 8.81 -> 8.54 |
| `opening_bg0.c`, move the `0x4B` arm up the `lay_blocks` chain | 8.12 -> 8.03 |
| `sc_sub.c`, lift one arm of `scfont_sqput2` | 9.31 -> 9.09 |
| `plapx.c`, split the 92-line pixel-format switch | 9.48 -> 9.38 |
| `MemMan.c`, lift the backward gap walk as well | 9.92 -> 9.38 |
| `cmd_main.c`, give both latch twins the same predicate | 9.68 -> 9.38 |

Every one made something look like something else. The accessor gave every zoom selector
the same short call where a long member chain had been. The arm move stripped
`op_bg0_lay_blocks_6` of the one arm that made it unlike `_4`. `plapx.c`'s parent, once
shortened, matched `set_apx_clut_format`, which is the same table minus a pitch line.

The question to ask before extracting is not whether the text is duplicated but **which two
functions will look more alike afterwards than they did before**. If that names a pair,
price it first.

### One new link in a dispatch chain is free, the second twins

*Added 2026-09-20, measured on `emlShim.c`.*

A chain of switches reached through `default` is the file's own idiom wherever one already
exists, and extending it once costs nothing. Extending it twice builds the duplication
group out of the links themselves.

`emlShim.c` had two functions at cc 9, one over `function_cyclomatic_complexity_warning`,
and already chained `checkOneCondition` into `checkOneIdCondition`:

| What was done | Score |
| --- | --- |
| baseline | 9.50 |
| guid and bank arms behind a new `default` | **9.68** |
| the note arm behind a second new `default` | 9.38 |

The first link clears `checkOneIdCondition` and stays under the ten-line duplication check.
The second clears Complex Method outright and is still worth less: four functions land in a
Code Duplication group, and two of them - `emlShimSeKeyOff` and `emlShimSeStop` - were
never touched. The links of a chain are the same shape by construction, which is what the
detector is looking for.

Take the first link. Record the second.

### Extracting a shared run does not break a skeleton pair

*Added 2026-09-20, measured four times.*

`bonus_bg.c` cleared a two-instance family with Recipe C on the run its two inits end with,
and that reads like a general answer to the pairs Recipe V refuses. It is not:

| File | What was shared and lifted | Score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `opening_bg0.c` | the four-statement init prefix, **five** call sites | 8.12 -> 8.12 |
| `opening_bg0.c` | the scroll settle both arms end with | 8.12 -> 8.12 |
| `sc_sub_gauges.c` | a seven-line prologue, **three** call sites | 9.38 -> 9.38 |
| `sc_sub_logo.c` | the in-loop quad and both band set-ups, ~15 lines of 55 | 9.38 -> 9.38 |

The last settles it: better than a quarter of each function removed, and the pair still
reads as a pair.

**What pairs these functions is their skeleton** - the sequence of loops and assignments -
and a verbatim run is not the skeleton. `bonus_bg.c` worked for a reason that does not
generalise: its functions were short enough that what remained fell under
`function_duplication_min_lines_of_code_for_check`, which is 10. Where the residue clears
ten lines, expect flat.

Measure the longest **balanced** shared run before starting - a run that straddles a closing
brace and the `for` after it cannot be lifted. Across the ten two-member pairs in the 9.38
band the longest balanced run is 0 to 3 lines in seven of them, which is not a run at all.

**Amended 2026-09-20 on the merge with `refactor/halve-the-yellow-band`, which had spent
both of this table's `opening_bg0.c` rows and kept them.** Everything above is right and
neither row should be reverted, for two reasons the flat score does not show.

The first is the ten-line threshold, read the other way round. A shared run shortens *both*
sides equally, so a pair that was over the threshold stays over it - which is why these
measure flat. Shorten **one** side and the same threshold works for you: `op_bg0_0006` lost
its step 0 to a helper and nothing else changed, and it fell under ten lines against
`op_bg0_0013`, taking the file 9.09 -> 9.38. Same mechanism, opposite symmetry. See the
one-arm rule and its precondition.

The second is that a flat score is not a flat result when Overall Code Complexity is open.
Each of these runs is a function, and a function is worth 3 off the gap between the file
mean and its threshold whatever it contains. `begin_bg0_scene` and `settle_bg0_scroll_y` -
the two rows above - are two of the six that took `opening_bg0.c` out of the finding, and
without them the moves that finally paid could not have been afforded. `begin_bg0_scene`
also dropped `op_bg0_0010` out of the duplication group on its own.

So: **expect flat, and check what the file is carrying before you revert on it.** Where
Overall Code Complexity is closed, this table's conclusion stands unchanged - a shared run
buys nothing and rule 2 says revert it.

### Recipe E reaches the branches Recipe P cannot name

*Added 2026-09-20, overturning the `arcade_char_data.c` plateau.*

The note read: `read_script` cannot leave Complex Method, because three of its ten branches
are the `||`s inside an `SDL_assert` and Recipe P cannot reach them. Both halves are true
and the conclusion does not follow. Recipe P cannot *name* a condition inside an assertion.
Recipe E does not name it - it carries the whole assertion somewhere else, and the branches
go with it.

`read_script` read its header - the `cgd_type` word, its assertion, and six single-byte
fields - before the loop that reads the body. Lifting the header is an ordinary Recipe E and
takes the three `||`s out of the parent as a side effect:

    read_script          cc 9 -> 5
    read_script_header        cc 5

**9.61 -> 9.92**, guard OK at 1222 literals unchanged.

The general form, and the fourth plateau overturned by reading a note narrowly: a note that
a recipe cannot reach a construct is a fact about *that recipe*. Before inheriting it, ask
whether a different recipe moves the construct whole.

### An else after a break is a level of nesting that carries no meaning

*Added 2026-09-20, measured on `MemMan.c`.*

The cheapest change in the campaign so far. Both gap walks wrote the exact-fit case as an
`if` ending in `break`, with the narrower-fit case in its `else`. The `else` is reachable
only by the path that skips the `break`, so dropping it and letting the second test follow
the first at the same depth changes no control flow at all.

    Deep, Nested Complexity   both functions at depth 4   ->  clear
    Bumpy Road Ahead          mm_find_gap_forward 2 bumps ->  clear
                              mmAllocSub          3 bumps ->  2

**9.24 -> 9.92**, guard OK at 9 literals unchanged, no function added.

It is worth applying to both copies precisely *because* it adds no function: the two walks
were equally similar before and after, and no duplication finding appeared. Contrast
lifting the backward walk into a function of its own, which clears the remaining bumps and
measures **9.92 -> 9.38** on the twin it makes.

Grepping the rest of the green band for `break`, `return` or `continue` followed by an
`else` found no other instance, so this one is spent - but it is the first thing to look
for in a band nobody has swept.
