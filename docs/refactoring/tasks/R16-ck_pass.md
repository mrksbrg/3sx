# R16 - refactor `src/sf33rd/Source/Game/com/ck_pass.c`

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Baseline Code Health | **3.75** / 10 (Red) |
| Exit target | **plateau** - no legal recipe raises the score further; record it |
| Hand-off point | **4.00** leaves the Red band. A small model stops there and hands on |
| Stretch target | 5.15 (CodeScene industry-average scenario) |
| File size | 3126 lines |
| Git churn | 5 commits |
| Risk tier | **CRITICAL** - CPU-opponent logic driving gameplay state. |
| Track | **B** (manual playtesting required - see note) |
| Recipes needed | A, P, G, E, X, then D/V/C and S |
| Suitable for | strongest available agent |

Recipe P is a copy-paste transformation and is safe for a small model. Recipe E needs
data-flow reasoning about which variables cross the extracted boundary - that is where
a weaker model fails silently while the build still succeeds. If this task is assigned
to a smaller model, restrict it to the Recipe P steps and leave the rest.

## 1. Read these first

- [`../PLAYBOOK.md`](../PLAYBOOK.md) - the only transformations you are allowed to apply.
- [`../README.md`](../README.md) - campaign rules and the definition of done.

## 2. Record the baseline before touching anything

Call both CodeScene MCP tools with an absolute path to your own checkout, and keep the
output for your report:

```
code_health_review(file_path="<repo>/src/sf33rd/Source/Game/com/ck_pass.c")
code_health_score(file_path="<repo>/src/sf33rd/Source/Game/com/ck_pass.c")
```

`cs review --output-format json <path>` on the CodeScene CLI gives the same thing without
the MCP round trip, and is fast enough to run on every commit.

The score read **3.75** on 2026-09-19 and the file is untouched since the campaign began.
If it does not, check [`../BACKLOG.md`](../BACKLOG.md) - that page is refreshed from full
sweeps and this task file is not - before stopping and reporting a mismatch.

## 3. What CodeScene flags here

Re-measured 2026-09-19; unchanged from the original sweep.

| Smell | Severity (1-3) | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bumpy Road Ahead | 3 | `KEN_vs` (8 bumps), `HUGO_vs` (7), `GILL_vs` (7) |
| Number of Functions in a Single Module | 2 | 201 functions |
| Complex Method | 2 | `KEN_vs` (cc 41), `GILL_vs` (37), `HUGO_vs` (33), `Check_Special_Technique` (14), `Check_After_Attack` (12), `Check_Limited_Attack` (12) |
| Large Method | 2 | `KEN_vs` (125 lines), `GILL_vs` (115), `HUGO_vs` (103) |
| Complex Conditional | 2 | `Check_After_Attack:864` (4), `Check_F_Cross_Chop:891` (3), `Check_Dash:609` (2) |
| Code Duplication | 2 | the `*_vs` family and the `VS_*_AS` family |
| Excess Number of Function Arguments | 2 | `Check_Special_Technique` (7), `Check_Specific_Term` (6), `Check_Limited_Attack` (6), `Check_VS_Squat` (5) |

The two duplication families matter for ordering: **fix the family before extracting from
any one of its members**, or the split multiplies the duplication instead of reducing it.
See *Never apply the same split across an already-duplicated family* in the playbook.

**Code Duplication** is flagged. When two blocks are identical, extract one shared helper
rather than editing both copies.

## 4. Target functions, highest leverage first

| # | Function | Line | Cyclomatic | Nesting | Bumps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `KEN_vs` | 31 | 41 | - | 8 |
| 2 | `GILL_vs` | 319 | 37 | - | 7 |
| 3 | `HUGO_vs` | 190 | 33 | - | 7 |
| 4 | `Check_Special_Technique` | 464 | 14 | - | - |
| 5 | `Check_After_Attack` | 843 | 12 | - | - |
| 6 | `Check_Limited_Attack` | 618 | 12 | - | - |
| 7 | `Check_VS_Jump` | 520 | 12 | - | - |
| 8 | `VS_HUGO_C` | 2651 | 9 | - | - |
| 9 | `VS_HUGO_B` | 1981 | 9 | - | - |

Thresholds for C: cyclomatic complexity under 9, nesting depth under 4.

## 5. Steps

Work **one function at a time, in the order above**. After each function run the
verification in section 6. Do not batch several functions into one change.

The 9 targets are grouped into **3 waves**. A wave is one sitting
and one pull request: do its steps, re-measure, report, open the PR, stop. Pick the
next wave up afterwards. Do not attempt every wave in one go - this file is
3126 lines and the review gets stale underneath you as you change it.

Re-run `code_health_review` at the start of each wave: line numbers below shift as
earlier waves land.

### Wave 1 - start here (one PR)

#### Step 1: `KEN_vs` (line 31)

- **Recipe E (extract function)** - 8 nested blocks; each bump is a missing function.
- **Recipe P (named predicate)** - move compound conditions into named boolean helpers.

Commit message: `refactor(ck_pass): simplify KEN_vs`

#### Step 2: `GILL_vs` (line 319)

- **Recipe E (extract function)** - 7 nested blocks; each bump is a missing function.
- **Recipe P (named predicate)** - move compound conditions into named boolean helpers.

Commit message: `refactor(ck_pass): simplify GILL_vs`

#### Step 3: `HUGO_vs` (line 190)

- **Recipe E (extract function)** - 7 nested blocks; each bump is a missing function.
- **Recipe P (named predicate)** - move compound conditions into named boolean helpers.

Commit message: `refactor(ck_pass): simplify HUGO_vs`

#### Step 4: `Check_Special_Technique` (line 464)

- **Recipe P (named predicate)** - move compound conditions into named boolean helpers.

Commit message: `refactor(ck_pass): simplify Check_Special_Technique`

### Wave 2 (one PR)

#### Step 5: `Check_After_Attack` (line 843)

- **Recipe P (named predicate)** - move compound conditions into named boolean helpers.

Commit message: `refactor(ck_pass): simplify Check_After_Attack`

#### Step 6: `Check_Limited_Attack` (line 618)

- **Recipe P (named predicate)** - move compound conditions into named boolean helpers.

Commit message: `refactor(ck_pass): simplify Check_Limited_Attack`

#### Step 7: `Check_VS_Jump` (line 520)

- **Recipe P (named predicate)** - move compound conditions into named boolean helpers.

Commit message: `refactor(ck_pass): simplify Check_VS_Jump`

#### Step 8: `VS_HUGO_C` (line 2651)

- **Recipe P (named predicate)** - move compound conditions into named boolean helpers.

Commit message: `refactor(ck_pass): simplify VS_HUGO_C`

### Wave 3 (one PR)

#### Step 9: `VS_HUGO_B` (line 1981)

- **Recipe P (named predicate)** - move compound conditions into named boolean helpers.

Commit message: `refactor(ck_pass): simplify VS_HUGO_B`

### When to stop

Stop at the end of your wave, even if you feel you could keep going.

If you are a small model, 4.00 is also a stopping point: the file has left the Red band,
and the transformations that remain need data-flow reasoning. Hand it on rather than
attempt them. If you are not, keep going to the plateau - the point where no legal recipe
raises the score further - and record that figure and its reason in your report.

## 6. Verification - run all three after EVERY step

**Step 1 - it still builds.**

```bash
export PATH="/c/msys64/mingw64/bin:$PATH"
cmake --build build
```

**Step 2 - no constant was removed or altered.**

```bash
python tools/refactor_guard.py src/sf33rd/Source/Game/com/ck_pass.c
```

A `FAIL` here means a literal disappeared or changed value - that is not a legal
refactor. Revert immediately. A `WARN` about *added* literals is normally fine
(a new guard clause brings its own `return 0`).

**Step 3 - the metric improved.**

```
code_health_score(file_path="E:/SynologyDrive/research/_agentic_refactoring/Street Fighter/git_win10/3sx/src/sf33rd/Source/Game/com/ck_pass.c")
```

- Score went **up**, build passed, guard passed: commit and continue.
- Guard **failed**: revert that step, no exceptions.
- Score **flat or down**: do *not* revert yet. Run the review and check whether the
  function you targeted left a category or dropped in complexity:

```
code_health_review(file_path="E:/SynologyDrive/research/_agentic_refactoring/Street Fighter/git_win10/3sx/src/sf33rd/Source/Game/com/ck_pass.c")
```

  This file has 3126 lines, so one function can move the aggregate score by
  less than its resolution. If the targeted function left Deep Nested Complexity,
  Bumpy Road, or Large Method, or its cyclomatic complexity fell: **keep and commit.**
  If it is still listed with the same numbers: revert with
  `git checkout -- src/sf33rd/Source/Game/com/ck_pass.c` and move on.

## 7. Definition of done

Either of these is a successful outcome:

- [ ] `code_health_score` >= 4.00, **or**
- [ ] every function in section 4 has left at least one smell category, with the
      before/after review pasted into the report
- [ ] `cmake --build build` succeeds with no new warnings
- [ ] `python tools/refactor_guard.py src/sf33rd/Source/Game/com/ck_pass.c` reports no removed literals
- [ ] Each commit covers one function and uses the message format above
- [ ] No behaviour change: no edits to literals, arithmetic, comparison operators, or the order of side effects
- [ ] Final `code_health_review` captured in the report
- [ ] statcheck runs clean across the replay corpus

## 8. Why this file is worth the effort

CodeScene projects that lifting this file to 5.15 yields, as a 90% confidence interval:

- **12% to 31%** fewer defects
- **2% to 13%** less development time

Model-based projections, not guarantees.
